To get a better understanding of how to compute Toda brackets, as well as illustrate some properties they have, I have calculated the four simple examples, which will serve as a warm-up for the future more complicated examples.

First, here are some preliminary information relevant to this subsection:

Let \( R = \Fb_2C_2 \), with \( g \in C_2 \) being the generator. Then \( \Stmod(R) \) is a triangulated category.

Then \( J = \tuple{1 + g} \) is the only ideal of \( R \).

First note that \( J \) is not projective, since the short exact sequence
\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm}{
			J \& R \& J \\
		};
	
		\draw[math]
			(m-1-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota} (m-1-2)
			(m-1-2) edge[two headed] node {\phi} (m-1-3);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
where \( \iota \) is the inclusion and \( \phi \) is the morphism
\begin{align*}
    \phi: R &\to J \\
    0, 1 + g &\mapsto 0 \\
    1, g &\mapsto 1 + g
\end{align*}
is not split.

This is because \( \iota \) is the only monomorphism of \( J \) into \( R \), but composes to \( 0 \) with \( \phi \). Therefore \( J \) cannot be projective, since every epimorphism into a projective module splits.

Furthermore, since \( \phi \) is an epimorphism with kernel \( J \), one gets from the third isomorphism theorem that \( \frac{R}{J} \cong J \).

The supension of \( J \) is the cokernel of \( \iota_J \). In \( \Mod(R) \), this is isomorphic to \( \frac{R}{J} \).

A sanity check:

The cone of \( \Id_J \) is the pushout of \( (\Id_J, \iota_J) \), where \( \iota_J \) is a monomorphism into the injective/projective module \( R \). By construction the pushout is \( \frac{R \oplus J}{\sim} \), where \( (0, 1+g) \sim (1+g, 0) \). One can see that this is isomorphic to \( R \). And, since \( R \) is projective, one has that \( R \cong 0 \) in \( \Stmod(R) \). Which is what is expected by a triangulated category.
