# master-thesis-topology

## Compilation instructions.

Compiled with latexmk (with lualatex flag).

Memoization package requires perl and perl-PDF-API2 installed.

latexmk + memoization requires a custom latexmkrc file (not included in this repository).

If memoization has been manually installed, then the latexmkrc file need to be updated with the proper paths to memoize-extract.pl and memoize-clean.pl.
