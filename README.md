## Compilation instructions.

Compiled with latexmk (with lualatex flag).

Memoization package requires perl and perl-PDF-API2 installed.

latexmk + memoization requires the custom .latexmkrc file.

If memoization has been manually installed, then memoize-extract.pl and memoize-clean.pl has to be added to $PATH.
