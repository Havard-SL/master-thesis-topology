As mentioned in the introduction, we have to define triangulated categories before we can talk about Massey products or Toda brackets in triangulated categories. This section contains a definition of triangulated categories as well as three examples: The Spanier--Whitehead category, the chain homotopy category, and the stable module category. The stable module category will be used for examples later on, so it is stated in more detail than the other two examples.

In the following three subsections we will consider three different triangulated categories, the first of which is inspired by topology, and the last two are inspired by algebra.
