As mentioned in the introduction, before one can talk about Massey products, Toda brackets, or the Adams spectral sequence on triangulated categroies, one has to start with knowing what a triangulated categoriy is. This sections is about defining triangulated categories as well as giving a couple of examples of triangulated categories, some of which will be important categories used later in the thesis.
