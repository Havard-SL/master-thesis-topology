\begin{definition}
    Let \( \Fb_3 \) be the finite field with \( 3 \) elements.

\begin{definition}
    Let \( C_3 \) be the cyclic group with \( 3 \) elements.

    be a quiver.
    Let \( g \in \Fb_3 C_3 \) be the generator of \( C_3 \).
    
    Then the algebra homomorphism defined as follows
    \begin{align*}
        \phi: \Fb_3 C_3 &\to \frac{\Fb_3\Gamma}{(\alpha^3)} \\
        1 &\mapsto e \\
        g &\mapsto \alpha + 1
    \end{align*}
    is an isomorphism from \( \Fb_3 C_3 \) to \( \frac{\Fb_3\Gamma}{(\alpha^3)} \).

\begin{theorem}
    One has that \( \Fb_3 C_3 \) has three distinct indecomposable modules up to isomorphism.
    
    They are isomorphic to \( \frac{\Fb_3C_3}{(1 + g)}, \frac{\Fb_3C_3}{(1 + g)^2}, \) and \( \Fb_3C_3 \), respectively.

    One has that \( \Hom_{\Fb_3C_3}(((1 + g), (1 + g)^2)) = \set{0, \mu} \), where \( \mu \) is defined as

% Show that there only is one non-trivial map between the indecomposable non-projective modules (Might not be true)

% Show that Sigma(S) = M, Sigma(M) = S.

% Show that S -> M -> S is exact.
% Show that S -> M -> S -> M is dist.
