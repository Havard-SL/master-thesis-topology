Toda brackets is a subset of morphisms in a triangulated category that satisfies certain properties. An interesting property of Toda brackets are that they are correlated with the differential in the second page of the Adams spectral sequence, which is the reason this thesis covers them. The details surrounding Toda brackets will become important moving on, and is the reason they are being properly defined in this thesis.
