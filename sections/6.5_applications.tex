The Adams spectral sequence is a spectral sequence introduced in 1958 by Adams for use in computing homotopy groups of spectra. In 1974, Miller generalized the Adams spectral sequence to be defined for any triangulated category \cite[Chapter I]{Miller_1975}. In 2017, Christen and Frankland \cite[Section 4, Section 6]{Christensen-Frankland_2017} showed that the page \( r \) differential of the Adams spectral sequence in a triangulated category can be expressed with respect to an \( (r + 1) \)-fold Toda bracket.

Therefore, by using three-fold Massey products, we can potentially calculate the page two differential of an Adams spectral sequence easier than conventional methods.
% TODO: Marius sa eg kunne skriva fleire detaljar rundt at det er notorisk vanskeleg å reikna med Adams spektralfølgjar, og andre ting.
