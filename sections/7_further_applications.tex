The Adams spectral sequence is a spectral sequence introduced in 1958 by John Frank Adams for use in computing homotopy groups of spectra. Later in 1974, Miller generalized the Adams spectral sequence to be defined in any triangulated category \cite[Chapter I]{Miller_1975}. In 2017, Christen and Frankland \cite[Section 4, Section 6]{Christensen-Frankland_2017} showed that the page \( r \) differential of the Adams spectral sequence in a triangulated category can be expressed with respect to a \( r \)-fold Toda bracket.

Therefore, by using three-fold Massey products, we can potentially calculate the page two differential of an Adams spectral sequence more efficiently than conventional methods.
