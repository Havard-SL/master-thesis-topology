The main goal of this thesis is to prove that Toda brackets and Massey products are equal in an algebraic triangulated category. We define triangulated categories, and prove why the stable module category is triangulated. Then we define Toda brackets on any triangulated category, and calculate some examples in the stable module category. Afterwards, we sketch a proof of why the category of chain complexes is symmetric monoidal closed, and use that to define the (enriched) category of DG-modules as the enriched functor category, along with every necessary preliminary to define algebraic triangulated categories by the way of (small) DG-enhancements. We define Massey products on the cohomology category of a DG-category, on the 0th cohomology category of the (enriched) category of DG-modules, as well as on any algebraic triangulated category. Finally, we calculate some examples of Massey products in the stable module category and see that they coincide with the previous examples of Toda brackets. We conclude with an application where the equality between Toda brackets and Massey products could be useful.
