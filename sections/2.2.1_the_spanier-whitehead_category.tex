The first example of a triangulated category is the Spanier-Whitehead category. It is one of the triangulated categories that shows up from the topological side.

First, some notation.
\begin{notation}
    For \( X, Y \) two topological spaces.

    Let \( \class{ X, Y } \) denote the homotopy class of continous functions from \( X \) to \( Y \).
\end{notation}

Now one can define the \emph{underlying} Spanier-Whitehead category. The triangulated structure will be descirbed afterwards.

The Spanier-Whitehead category is motivated by the Freudental suspension theorem and historically lead to the definition of the stable homotopy category.

\begin{definition}[Spanier-Whitehead category]
    Let \( SW \) be the category with the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {
            Objects in \( SW \) are touples of pointed CW-complexes and an integer, \( X, n \).
        }
        \item {
            Let \( \Sigma \) here denote the based suspension of a topological space.

            % MS-Question: Er dette riktig? MÃ¥ r >= max(|n_X| + 2, |n_Y|)?
            Morphisms in \( SW \) are the following colimits of abelian groups
            \[
                \Hom\tuple{ (X, n_X), (Y, n_Y) } := \colim_{q \to \infty} \class{ \Sigma^{n_X + q}(X), \Sigma^{n_Y + q}(Y) }
            \]
        }
        \item {
            % TODO lim-colim nat. iso? How to explain this?
            Composition... TODO
        }
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

It can be shown that the Spanier-Whietehead category is an additive category.

To see the triangulated structure of the Spanier-Whitehead category it is necessary to define the shift functor and the class of distinguished triangles.

\begin{definition}[Shift functor in \( SW \)]
    Let \( \Sigma \) be the following assignment of objects and morphisms in \( SW \).

    Let
    \[
        \Sigma(X, n) := (X, n + 1),
    \] 
    and for \( f: (X, n_X) \to (Y, n_Y) \), let
    \[
        \Sigma(f) := f.
    \]

    This can be shown to be a functor, and in fact is an automorphism.
\end{definition}

As the notation would imply, in \( SW \), one has that \( \Sigma(X, n) = (X, n + 1) \cong ( \Sigma X, n ) \).

\begin{definition}[Distinguished triangles in \( SW \)]
    WIP
\end{definition}
