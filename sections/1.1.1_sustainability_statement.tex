While pure mathematics seemingly has no real world impact, it has been repeatedly proven that pure maths appear in other fields of study in the future and provides tools to solve problems that can appear in the real world. Topology in particular, has a deep history connected to optimization problems, and in newer times have been used in data analysis and other fields. This thesis could therefore bring future benefit to the physical sciences as well as data analysis which are key fields for future innovation. Given the potential widespread applicability of pure topology research, this thesis could contribute to goal number 3 for good health and well being, by being a tool that could be used in the medical field, as well as goal 9 for industry, innovation and infrastructure, by creating tools that could potentially be used to drive new innovations.

Of course, given the potential wide applicability of this pure research in the future, it could contribute to other goals, but the two abovementioned goals, namely goal 3 and 9, are the ones where topology is currently being used to some degree.
