In this subsection, the goal is to define everything needed to understand how Massey products can almost equal Toda brackets. The biggest roadblock to reaching that goal is defining what an algebraic triangulated category is.

There are multiple definitions of an algebraic triangulated category. In this thesis, the definition of an algebraic triangulated category will be the existence of a DG-enhancement as defined in \cite[Definition 3.1.3]{Jasso-Muro_2023}. This subsection goes through this definition in detail, and ends with defining the massey product on an algebraic triangulated category.
