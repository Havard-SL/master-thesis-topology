As mentioned in the introduction, triangulated categories appear both in topology and in algebra.

The first example of a triangulated category is the Spanier-Whitehead category. It is one of the triangulated categories that shows up from the topological side.

\begin{definition}[Spanier-Whitehead category]
    Let \( SW \) be the category with the following properties:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {
            Objects in \( SW \) are pointed CW-complexes. WIP
        }
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
