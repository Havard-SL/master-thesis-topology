\begin{notation}
    Let \( \Cc \) be any additive category.
    
    Then let \( \C \tuple{\Cc} \) denote the category of chain complexes of objects in \( \Cc \).

    Furthermore let the differential in these chain complexes have \emph{ascending} order. I.e. for \( M_i, M_{i+1} \in \Cc \) which are adjacent objects in a chain complex \( M \in \C \tuple{\Cc} \), the differential would be
    \[
        d_i : M_i \to M_{i + 1}.
    \]
\end{notation}

\begin{notation}
    In this section, there will be a lot of products and coproducts of modules mentioned, and so a small note on the notation of elements, and the reasoning behind the notation could be useful.

    Let \( R \) be a commutative ring with identity. Let \( A_i \in \Mod(R) \) and let
    \[
        \iota_i: A_i \to \coprod_{i \in \Zb} A_i
    \]
    denote the canonical split monomorphism by the universal property of the coproduct.

    Then for any \( a_i \in A_i \), the element
    \[
        \iota_i(a_i) \in \coprod_{i \in \Zb} A_i
    \]
    is just denoted as
    \[
        a_i \in \coprod_{i \in \Zb} A_i.
    \]
    
    The reasoning for the above notation, is that since the coproduct in \( \Mod(R) \) is the direct sum, any element of the coproduct can be written as the sum of such \( a_i \)'s. In addition usually when defining morphisms on the coproduct, it is fully defined by the various \( a_i \)'s
