The main purpose of this thesis is to prove the equality between Toda brackets and Massey products in an algebraic triangulated category. \autoref{section:tri_cats} through \autoref{section:alg_tri_cats} will consist of the necessary preliminaries for the proof, while \autoref{section:toda_eq_massey} contains the proof itself. At the end we will conclude with an application where the equality could be useful.
