The main purpose of this thesis is to prove the equality (up to a sign) between Toda brackets and Massey products in an algebraic triangulated category. \autoref{section:2} through \autoref{section:4} will consist of the necessary preliminaries for the proof, while \autoref{section:5} contains the proof itself. Finally, \autoref{section:6} will wrap up the thesis with an application for this equality, by calculating the page 2 differential of an Adams spectral sequence using massey products.
