The main purpose of this thesis is to prove the equality (up to a sign) between Toda brackets and Massey products in an algebraic triangulated category. \autoref{section:tri_cats} through \autoref{section:alg_tri_cats} will consist of the necessary preliminaries for the proof, while \autoref{section:toda_eq_massey} contains the proof itself. Finally, in \autoref{section:applications} we will look at potential applications where the equality could be useful.
