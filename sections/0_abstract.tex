The main purpose of this thesis is to prove the equality (up to a sign) between Toda brackets and Massey products in an algebraic triangulated category. \autoref{section:2} through \autoref{section:5} will consist of the necessary preliminaries for the proof, while \autoref{section:6} contains the proof itself. Finally, in \autoref{section:7} we will look at potential applications where the equality could be useful.
