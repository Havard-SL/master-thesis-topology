The main purpose of this thesis is to prove the equality (up to a sign) between Toda brackets and Massey products in an algebraic triangulated category. Section 2 until 4 will consist of the necessary preliminaries for the proof, while section 5 contains the proof itself. Lastly, section 6 will wrap up the thesis with an application for this equality, by calculating the page 2 differential of an Adams spectral sequence using massey products.
