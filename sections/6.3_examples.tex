Let \( \Ac \) be the full DG-subcategory of \( \C_{\dg} \), where the objects are exact chain complexes consisting only of injective/projective modules.

Then \( \Mc \) is equivalent to \( H^0(\Ac) \) through the functor \( \Phi \), which is the following functor:

For any \( A \in \Mc \), consider the projective and injective resolutions:
\[
    \cdots \to 0 \to A \to I_1 \to I_2 \to \cdots
\]
\[
    \cdots \to P_2 \to P_1 \to A \to 0 \to \cdots
\]

Gluing them together yields the following exact chain complex, where \( I_1 \) is in degree \( 0 \).
\[
    E: \cdots \to P_2 \to P_1 \to I_1 \to I_2 \to \cdots
\]

Then define \( \Phi(A) := E \).
