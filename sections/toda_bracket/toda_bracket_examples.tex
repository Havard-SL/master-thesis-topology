Let \( R = \Fb_2C_2 \), with \( g \in C_2 \) being the generator.

Then \( J = \tuple{1 + g} \) is the only ideal of \( R \).

First note that \( J \) is not projective, since the short exact sequence:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm}{
			J \& R \& J \\
		};
	
		\draw[math]
			(m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota} (m-1-2)
			(m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\phi} (m-1-3);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Where, \( \iota \) is the inclusion, and \( \phi \) is the map:

\begin{align*}
    \phi: R &\to J \\
    0, 1 + g &\mapsto 0 \\
    1, g &\mapsto 1 + g
\end{align*}

But \( \phi \) does not split, since \( \iota \) is the only monomorphism of \( J \) into \( R \), but composes to \( 0 \) with \( \phi \). Therefore \( J \) cannot be projective, since every epimorphism into a projective module splits.

Furthermore, since \( \phi \) is an epimorphism with kernel \( J \), one gets from the third isomorphism theorem that \( \frac{R}{J} \cong J \).
