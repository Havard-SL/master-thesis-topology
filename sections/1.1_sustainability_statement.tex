While pure mathematics seemingly has no real world impact, it has been repeatedly proven that pure mathematics appear in other fields of study in the future and provides tools to solve problems that can appear in the real world. Topology in particular, has a deep history connected to optimization problems, and in newer times have been used in data analysis and other fields. This thesis could therefore bring future benefit to the physical sciences as well as data analysis which are key fields for future innovation. Given the potential widespread applicability of pure topology research, this thesis could contribute greatly to the UN's sustainability goal number 3 and 9. First, goal number 3 for good health and well-being, as topology can be and already is being used for data analysis in medical research. And second, as goal number 9 for industry, innovation, and infrastructure, since topology can be used to further innovation.

Of course, given the potential wide applicability of topological techniques in the future, it could contribute to other goals, but the two aforementioned sustainability goals, namely goal 3 and 9, are the ones where topology is currently being used to some degree.
