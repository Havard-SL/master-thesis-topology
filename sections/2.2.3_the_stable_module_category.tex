% TODO: Kan generaliserast til endeleg gen modular om R er noetherske. Og det verkar som Frobenius ringar er noetherske. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-Frobenius_ring Zimmermann: Prop. 5.1.4

A triangulated category that will be central in this thesis is the stable module category. Therefore the definition will be given in more details than the previous two examples of triangulated categories.

Before showing the triangulated structure, it is as usual necessary to define the underlying category first. However, the underlying category require some lemmas to be well-defined.

First, a lemma that will be used to define the morphisms in the stable module category.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:morphisms_factoring_through_projectives_r-submodule}
    Let \( R \) be a commutative ring with identity.

    Let \( G \) be the subset of \( \Mod(R)(A, B) \) consisting of module morphisms that factor through a projective object.

    Then \( G \) is an \( R \)-submodule of \( \Mod(R)(A, B) \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let \( f \) and \( g \) be two morphisms that factor through the projectives \( P \) and \( Q \) respectively. Then we have the following commutative diagrams
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& P \& B \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {f_1} (m-1-2)
                    edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {f} (m-1-3)
                (m-1-2) edge node {f_2} (m-1-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
        and
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& Q \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {g_1} (m-1-2)
                    edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {g} (m-1-3)
                (m-1-2) edge node {g_2} (m-1-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    One can then construct the morphism
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& {P \oplus Q} \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {
                    \begin{psmallmatrix}
                        f_1 \\
                        g_1
                    \end{psmallmatrix}
                } (m-1-2)
                (m-1-2) edge node {(f_2, g_2)} (m-1-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Composing these two morphisms, one gets the morphism \( f_2 \circ f_1 + g_2 \circ g_1 = f + g \). This morphisms factors thorugh \( P \oplus Q \), which is projective since it is a direct sum of projective modules.

    Therefore, the set of homomorphisms that factor through a projective is closed under addition. Multiplying with a ring element still factors through the same projective, since every morphism is an \( R \) homomorphism. Therefore the set of morphisms that factor through a projective is an \( R \)-submodule.
\end{proof}

From now on, in this subsection let \( \Mod(R)(A, B)/G \), with \( R \) a commutative ring with identity, simply be denoted as \( \Mc(A, B) \).

Second is the result that makes composition in the stable module category well-defined.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_composition_well-defined}
    Define the binary operation \( c \) as follows
    \begin{align*}
        c: \Mc(B, C) \times \Mc(A, B) &\to \Mc(A, C) \\
        [g] \times [f] &\mapsto [g \circ f].
    \end{align*}

    Then \( c \) is well-defined.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Need to check that two different choices of representatives of \( [f] \) and \( [g] \) yields the same value.

    Let \( [f + \widetilde{f}] \) and \( [g + \widetilde{g}] \) be two different representatives of \( [f] \) and \( [g] \), with \( \widetilde{f} \) and \( \widetilde{g} \) factoring through some projectives.

    Then it follows that
    \[
         [g + \widetilde{g}] \circ [f + \widetilde{f}] = [g \circ f] + [\widetilde{g} \circ f] + [g \circ \widetilde{f}] + [\widetilde{g} \circ \widetilde{f}].
    \]
    
    Every term other than \( [g \circ f] \) factors through a projective and is therefore equal to \( 0 \) in \( \Mc(A, C) \).
\end{proof}

Finally one can define the underlying stable module category.

% TODO: Frobenius algebra for sterk antaking?
\begin{definition}
    \label{def:stable_module_category}
    Let \( R \) be a \emph{Frobenius ring}.

    Then the \emph{stable module category over \( R \)}, denoted \( \Mc \) in this thesis, is defined in the following way:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {
            The objects are infinitely generated modules over \( R \).
        }
        \item {
            For \( A, B \in \Mc \), let \( \Mc(A, B) \) be defined as previously.
        }
        \item {
            For \( [g] \in \Mc(B, C) \), and \( [f] \in \Mc(A, B) \), let composition be defined as follows
            \[
                [g] \circ [f] := [g \circ f].
            \]
        }
    \end{enumerate}

    This category is called the \emph{infinitely generated stable module category over \( R \)}.
\end{definition}

Other authors typically use the notation \( \StMod(R) \) or \( \underline{\Mod}(R) \) for the infinitely generated stable module category. However, for the sake of brevity this is reduced to simply \( \Mc \) in this thesis.

In the general definition of the infinitely generated stable module category, it is not required that the ring is a Frobenius ring. However, as will become apparent later in this subsection is that it is a requirement to having a triangulated structure defined on it. Since this thesis will only be considering the stable module category as a triangulated category, this assumption is made from the beginning.
% TODO: Faktasjekk, er det verkeleg sant at Frobenius er naudsynt? Las eg ikkje ein stad at nok injektiv og projektive og dei samanfaller er godt nok?

In order to be an underlying category of a triangulated category, a category needs to be additive.

% MS-Question: Er det lov å skriva First/Second, show .... Eller er det ein ufulstendig setning igjen.
\begin{lemma}
    \( \Mc \) is an additive category.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    There are two parts to this proof. First, show that \( \Mc \) is pre-additive and then second, show that \( \Mc \) has finite products which in addition to being pre-additive would imply that \( \Mc \) is additive by TODO:Cite.
    % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_category

    To show that \( \Mc \) is pre-additive there are two properties that need to be shown
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {
            First, show that for any \( A, B \in \Mc \) that \( \Mc(A, B) \) is an abelian group.

            This follows immediately, since \( \Mc(A, B) \) is the quotient of an \( R \)-module, and is therefore an \( R \)-module and, hence, an abelian group.
        }
        \item {
            Second, show that composition is bilinear.

            Consider \( [g], [g'] \in \Mc(B, C) \) and \( [f], [f'] \in \Mc(A, B) \). Consider the following equation
            \begin{align*}
                ([g] + [g']) \circ ([f] + [f']) &= [g + g'] \circ [f + f'] \\
                &= \class{(g + g') \circ (f + f')} \\
                &= \class{g \circ f + g \circ f' + g' \circ f + g' \circ f'} \\
                &= [g] \circ [f] + [g] \circ [f'] + [g'] \circ [f] + [g'] \circ [f'],
            \end{align*}
            which is precisely bilinearity.
        }
    \end{enumerate}

    The claim is that the usual biproduct in \( \Mod(R) \) is the product in \( \Mc \). Let the following be the commutative diagram for the universal property of \( A \oplus B \) as a product in \( \Mod(R) \), but in \( \Mc \) with respect to some object \( X \).
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1.5cm}{1.5cm} {
                \& X \\
                A \& A \oplus B \& B \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-2) edge node[swap] {[f_A]} (m-2-1)
                    edge[dashed] node {[f]} (m-2-2)
                    edge node {[f_B]} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-2) edge node[swap] {[\pi_B]} (m-2-3)
                    edge node {[\pi_A]} (m-2-1);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Let \( [g]: X \to A \times B \) be another morphism that satisfies the universal property.

    Then the following diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1.5cm}{1.5cm} {
                \& X \\
                A \& A \oplus B \& B \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-2) edge node[swap] {[0]} (m-2-1)
                    edge[dashed] node {[f - g]} (m-2-2)
                    edge node {[0]} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-2) edge node[swap] {[\pi_B]} (m-2-3)
                    edge node {[\pi_A]} (m-2-1);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    commutes.

    Let \( \iota_A, \iota_B \) denote the canonical split monomorphisms from the universal property of the coproduct. Since \( A \oplus B \) is a biproduct in \( \Mod(R) \) one has
    \[
        \Id_{A \oplus B} = \iota_A \circ \pi_A + \iota_B \circ \pi_B.
    \]
    Consider the following equation,
    \begin{align*}
        [f - g] &= [\Id_{A \oplus B} \circ (f - g)] \\
        &= [\iota_A \circ \pi_A \circ (f - g) + \iota_B \circ \pi_B \circ (f - g)] \\
        &= [\iota_A] \circ [\pi_A \circ (f - g)] + [\iota_B] \circ [\pi_B \circ (f - g)] \\
        &= [0],
    \end{align*}
    which implies that \( [f] = [g] \), and that \( A \oplus B \) is a product in \( \Mc \), and by the statement at the start, also a biproduct.
\end{proof}

This thesis starts by defining the functor \( \Omega \), which will be shown later to be the inverse of the shift functor.

But in order to properly define \( \Omega \), a couple of prerequisites are needed first.

An important property of the category of modules over a commutative ring with identity is that it has \emph{enough projectives} and \emph{enough injectives}. Having enough projectives means that for any module \( A \), there exists some projective module \( P_A \) dependent on \( A \), as well as an epimimorphism, \( \pi_A \) from \( P_A \) to \( A \). The choice of \( P_A \) and \( \pi_A \) is \emph{not necessarily unique} and two different choices of \( P_A \) \emph{could be non-isomorphic}. Similarly, having enough injectives means that for any module \( A \) there exists some injective module \( I_A \) along with a monomorphism \( \iota_A \) from \( A \) to \( I_A \). Equal to the projective case, \( I_A \) is \emph{not neccesarily unique up to isomorphism} and \( \iota_A \) is \emph{not necessarily unique}.

However, in defining \( \Omega \), the definition is closely tied to a choice of \( P_A \)s and \( \pi_A \)s. It is important that the definition is well-defined, so a choice of projective objects and epimorphisms are made in advance. Also, the definition of \( \Omega \) is tied to the kernel of the choice of \( \pi_A \), and it therefore makes sense to fix a choice of kernel as well, since it is also not unique (only up to isomorphism).

% Similarly, let \( I \) be a collection of tuples of an injective module, a monomorphisms, and a module, where for any module \( B \in \Mod(R) \), there is some tuple \( \tuple{I_A, \iota_A, \Sigma A} \) such that \( \iota_A \) is a monomorphism from \( A \) to \( \iota_A \), and \( \Sigma A \) is a choice of cokernel of \( \iota_A \).

\begin{definition}[The functor \( \Omega \)]
    \label{def:stmod_omega}
    Since \( \Mod(R) \) has enough projectives, let \( P \) be a collection of tuples for every object \( A \), on the form \( P = \set{\tuple{P_A, \pi_A, \Omega A}}_{A \in \Mod(R)} \), consisting of a projective module \( P_A \), an epimorphism \( \pi_A \), and a module \( \Omega A \), where \( \pi_A \) is an epimorphism from \( P_A \) to \( A \), and \( \Omega A \) is a kernel of \( \pi_A \).

    Then define \( \Omega \) as the assignment of objects and morphisms in \( \Mc \) as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {
            For any object \( A \) in \( \Mc \), let \( \Omega A \) be as defined in \( P \) above.
        }
        \item {
            For any \( [f] \in \Mc(A, B) \), let \( \Omega([f]) \) be constructed as follows:

            Consider the following diagram in \( \Mod(R) \), with the relevant objects and morphisms from \( P \) defined above
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                        {\Omega B} \& {P_B} \& B. \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                            edge node {\Omega'(f)} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                            edge node {p_f} (m-2-2)
                        (m-1-3) edge node {f} (m-2-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                        (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}

            One has that for a morphism \( f: A \to B \), there exists a morphism \( p_f \) from the lifitng property of projective modules such that the right square commutes. Note that the choice of \( p_f \) is \emph{not neccesarily unique}.

            Furthermore, since
            \[
                \pi_B \circ p_f \circ \iota_A = f \circ \pi_A \circ \iota_A = f \circ 0 = 0,
            \]
            one has from the universal kernel property that there exists a unique morphism, dependent on the choice of \( p_f \), denoted as \( \Omega'(f) \) from \( \Omega A \) to \( \Omega B \) such that the left square in the above diagram commutes. Taking the equivalence class of this morphism with respect to morphisms factoring through projectctives yields the morphism defined by the assignment, i.e., \( \Omega [f] := \class{\Omega'(f)} \).
        }
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The goal is to show that the above assignment is a well-defined endofunctor, and later showing that it is in fact an additive auto-equivalence of categories.

The following is the lemma showing that \( \Omega \) is a well-defined assignment of morphisms.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_omega_f_is_well_defined}
    \( \Omega \) is a well-defined assignment of morphisms.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    There are two things that need to be proven. First, in the construction of \( \Omega'(f) \), one has to choose a morphism \( p_f \) from the projective property. Needs to show that if one choses another projective morphism, that \( \Omega \) still yields the same morphism in \( \Mc \). Second, one need to show that if \( f \sim g \), then \( \Omega'(f) \sim \Omega'(g) \).

    To prove the first part, let \( p_f \) and \( \widetilde{p_f} \) be two different projective morphisms that give the morphisms \( \Omega'(f) \) and \( \widetilde{\Omega'(f)} \), respectively. Then one has the following commutative diagram excluding the dotted arrow
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega B} \& {P_B} \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Omega'(f) - \widetilde{\Omega'(f)}} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge[dashed, swap] node {\phi} (m-2-1)
                    edge node {p_f - \widetilde{p_f}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {f -f = 0} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Since
    \[
        \pi_B \circ \tuple{p_f - \widetilde{p_f}} = \tuple{f - f} \circ \pi_A = 0
    \]
    there exists a morphism \( \phi \) induced by the kernel property of \( \Omega B \), such that the lower triangle in the diagram commutes. However, since \( \iota_B \) is a monomorphism, one also gets that the upper triangle commutes. This implies that the morphism \( \Omega'(f) - \widetilde{\Omega'(f)} \) factors through \( P_A \), a projective module. Therefore
    \[
        0 = \class{\Omega'(f) - \widetilde{\Omega'(f)}} = \class{\Omega'(f)} - \class{\widetilde{\Omega'(f)}}
    \]
    which implies that \( \Omega [f] \) is independent of the choice of \( p_f \).

    Second, one needs to show that if \( f \sim g \), then \( \Omega f \sim \Omega g \). Consider the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrow,
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{3cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \&\& P \\
                \Omega B \& P_B \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge node {\Omega'(f) - \Omega'(g)} (m-3-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node {p_f - p_g} (m-3-2)
                (m-1-3) edge[swap] node {(f - g)_1} (m-2-3)
                    edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {f - g} (m-3-3)

                (m-2-3) edge[swap, dashed] node {\theta} (m-3-2)
                    edge[swap] node {(f - g)_2} (m-3-3)

                (m-3-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_B} (m-3-2)
                (m-3-2) edge[two heads] node[swap] {\pi_B} (m-3-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Let \( P \) be the projective that \( f - g \) factors through. Then from the projective property, there exists a morphism \( \theta: P \to P_B \), which causes the lower triangle to commute.

    Let \( p'_{f - g} := \theta \circ (f - g)_1 \circ \pi_A \). By construction, one has that both \( p_f - p_g \) and \( p'_{f - g} \) are morphisms that would make the right hand square commute.
    
    But since
    \[
        p'_{f - g} \circ \iota_A = \theta \circ (f-g)_1 \circ \pi_A \circ \iota_A = \theta \circ (f-g)_1 \circ 0 = 0,
    \]
    it implies that if the leftmost morphism in the diagram was \( 0 \) and the middle morphism was \( p'_{f - g} \), it would commute. By the previous part of this proof, since the two possible middle morphisms, \( p_f - p_g \) and \( p'_{f - g} \), produce two different leftmost morphisms \( \Omega'(f) - \Omega'(g) \) and \( 0 \), one has that \( \Omega [f] = \Omega [g] \).
\end{proof}

Now that \( \Omega \) is a well-defined asssignment of objects and morphisms, it only remains to prove functoriality as well as showing that the identity is mapped to the identity to show that it is a functor.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_omega_endofunctor}
    \( \Omega \) is an endofunctor on \( \Mc \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    To show that \( \Omega \) is a functor it remains to prove functoriality as well as showing that the identity is mapped to the identity.

    First want to show that \( \Omega \) is functorial. Let \( A, B, C \in \Mc \). Then by the definition of \( \Omega \), one has the following commutative diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega B} \& {P_B} \& B \\
                {\Omega C} \& {P_C} \& C \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] (m-1-2)
                    edge[curve={height=30pt}, swap] node {\Omega'(g \circ f)} (m-3-1)
                    edge node {\Omega'(f)} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] (m-1-3)
                    edge node {p_f} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {f} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] (m-2-2)
                    edge node {\Omega'(g)} (m-3-1)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] (m-2-3)
                    edge node {p_g} (m-3-2)
                (m-2-3) edge node {g} (m-3-3)

                (m-3-1) edge[hook] (m-3-2)
                (m-3-2) edge[two heads] (m-3-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Considering the composition of the vertical morphisms, one ends up with the following commutative diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega C} \& {P_C} \& C. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Omega'(g) \circ \Omega'(f)} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node {p_g \circ p_f} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {g \circ f} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_C} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_C} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Since \( \Omega \) is a well-defined assignment of morphisms, this implies
    \[
        \Omega([g]) \circ \Omega([f]) = \class{\Omega'(g) \circ \Omega'(f)} = \Omega \class{g \circ f}.
    \]

    Second, need to show that \( \Omega \Id_A = \Id_{\Omega A} \) in \( \Mc \).

    By a similar argument to above, one can see that every square and triangle in the following diagram commutes
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Id_{\Omega A}} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] (m-1-3)
                    edge node {\Id_{P_A}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {\Id_A} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Therefore \( \Omega \class{\Id_A} = \class{\Id_{\Omega A}} \).
\end{proof}

An important detail still missing to show that \( \Omega^{-1} \) could be a shift functor is showing that \( \Omega \) is additive.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_omega_additive_functor}
    \( \Omega \) is an additive functor.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Want to show that \( \Omega(f + g) \sim \Omega(f) + \Omega(g) \).
    
    There are two posssible values of \( \Omega'(f + g) \), namely the ones from either of the two commutative diagrams below
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega B} \& {P_B} \& B \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Omega'(f + g)} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node[swap] {p_{f + g}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node[swap] {f + g} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega B} \& {P_B} \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Omega'(f)+\Omega'(g)} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node[swap] {p_f + p_g} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node[swap] {f + g} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Since \( \Omega [f + g] \) is well-defined, this implies \( \Omega [f + g] = \Omega([f]) + \Omega([g]) \).
\end{proof}

One can define another functor, \( \Sigma \), which will turn out to be the inverse of \( \Omega \) and the future shift functor in making \( \Mc \) a triangulated category.

\begin{definition}[The functor \( \Sigma \)]
    \label{def:stmod_sigma}
    Since \( \Mod(R) \) has enough projectives, let \( I \) be a collection of tuples for every object \( A \), on the form \( I = \set{\tuple{I_A, \kappa_A, \Omega A}}_{A \in \Mod(R)} \), consisting of an injective module \( I_A \), a monomorphism \( \kappa_A \), and a module \( \Sigma A \), where \( \kappa_A \) is an monomorphism from \( A \) to \( P_A \), and \( \Sigma A \) is a cokernel of \( \kappa_A \).

    Then define \( \Sigma \) as the assignment of objects and morphisms in \( \Mc \) as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {
            For any object \( A \) in \( \Mc \), let \( \Sigma A \) be as defined in \( I \) above.
        }
        \item {
            \( \Sigma [f] \) is constructed as follows:

            Consider the following diagram in \( \Mod(R) \)
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        A \& I_A \& \Sigma A \\
                        B \& I_B \& \Sigma B. \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\kappa_A} (m-1-2)
                            edge node {f} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\rho_A} (m-1-3)
                            edge node {i_f} (m-2-2)
                        (m-1-3) edge node {\Sigma'(f)} (m-2-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\kappa_B} (m-2-2)
                        (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\rho_B} (m-2-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}

            One has that for a morphism \( f: A \to B \), there exists a morphism \( i_f \) from the universal property of injective objects such that the left square commutes. Please note that this morphism is \emph{not neccesarily} unique.

            Furthermore, since
            \[
                \kappa_B \circ i_f \circ \rho_A = \kappa_B \circ \rho_B \circ f = 0,
            \]
            one has from the universal cokernel property that there exists a unique morphism, dependant on the choice of \( i_f \), denoted as \( \Sigma'(f) \) from \( \Sigma A \) to \( \Sigma B \) such that the right square in the above diagram commutes. Taking the equivalence class of this morphism with respect to morphisms factoring through projectives yields the morphism defined by the functor, i.e., \( \Sigma [f] := \class{\Sigma'(f)} \).
        }
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Now it remains to show every desired property of \( \Omega \), like being a well-defined, an endofunctor, and additive. However, that is a lot of work, that can luckily be skipped because of the previous legwork on proving the respective properties for \( \Omega \).

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_sigma_well-defined_additive_endofunctor}
    \( \Sigma \) is a well-defined and additive endofunctor on \( \Mc \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The proofs of the various statements are entirely dual to the proofs of \autoref{lem:stmod_omega_f_is_well_defined}, \autoref{lem:stmod_omega_endofunctor} and \autoref{lem:stmod_omega_additive_functor}.
\end{proof}

Now one can finally show that \( \Sigma = \Omega^{-1} \).

\begin{theorem}
    \( \Omega \) is an auto-equivalence with inverse \( \Sigma \).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    This thesis will only show that \( \Id_{\Mc} \) is naturally isomorphic to \( \Sigma\Omega \). The omitted part that \( \Id_{\Mc} \) is naturally isomorphic to \( \Omega\Sigma \) is very similar, and uses many dual properties.

    First show that for any \( A \in \Mc \), there exists an isomorphism \( A \to \Sigma\Omega A \). Consider the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrows
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \Omega A \& I_{\Omega A} \& \Sigma \Omega A \\
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A, \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[equal] (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge[dashed] node {i_{\phi_1}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge[dashed] node {\phi_1} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\kappa_{\Omega A}} (m-2-2)
                    edge[equal] (m-3-1)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\rho_{\Omega A}} (m-2-3)
                    edge[dashed] node {i_{\phi_2}} (m-3-2)
                (m-2-3) edge[dashed] node {\phi_2} (m-3-3)

                (m-3-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-3-2)
                (m-3-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-3-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    then there exists \( i_{\phi_1} \) from the injective property morphism induced from \( \iota_A \). Then since \( \Mod(R) \) is an abelian category, \( A \) is a cokernel of \( \iota_A \), and by
    \[
        \rho_{\Omega A} \circ i_{\phi_1} \circ \iota_A = \rho_{\Omega A} \circ \kappa_{\Omega A} = 0,
    \]
    one gets from the cokernel property that there is a uniquely induced morphism \( \phi_1: A \to \Sigma\Omega A \). Then doing the same for the lower rectangle of the diagram, using the fact that every projective is also injective, then one gets the morphisms \( i_{\phi_2} \) and \( \phi_2 \) by similar arguments, such that the diagram above including the dashed arrows commute.

    Then to show that \( \phi_1 \) and \( \phi_2 \) are isomorphisms, consider the following diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Id_{\Omega A} \circ \Id_{\Omega A} - \Id_{\Omega A} = 0} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge[swap] node {i_{\phi_2} \circ i_{\phi_1} - \Id_{P_A}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge[swap, dashed] node {\theta} (m-2-2)
                    edge node {\phi_2 \circ \phi_1 - \Id_A} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Using the previous commutative diagram, one gets that every square commutes. But since
    \[
        (p_{\phi_2} \circ p_{\phi_1} - \Id_{P_A}) \circ \iota_A = \iota_A \circ 0 = 0,
    \]
    then from the cokernel property there exist a morphism \( \theta: A \to P_A \) such that the upper triangle commutes. But then one has that
    \[
        (\phi_2 \circ \phi_1 - \Id_A) \circ \pi_A = \pi_A \circ (p_{\theta_2} \circ p_{\theta_1} - \Id_{P_A}) = \pi_A \circ \theta \circ \pi_A,
    \]
    and since \( \pi_A \) is an epimorphism, one gets that the lower triangle commutes. This implies that \( \phi_2 \circ \phi_1 \sim \Id_A \).
    
    By a similar agument that is omitted for brevity, one can show that \( \phi_1 \circ \phi_2 \sim \Id_{\Sigma\Omega A} \), which means that \( [\phi_1] \) and \( [\phi_2] \) are isomorphisms from \( A \) to \( \Sigma\Omega A \).

    To show that these isomorphisms are natural, let \( [f] \in \Mc(A, B) \) and consider the following two diagrams
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P \& A \\
                \Omega A \& I \& \Sigma \Omega A \\
                \Omega B \& I \& \Sigma \Omega B, \\
            };

                (m-1-3) edge node {\phi^A_1} (m-2-3)

        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    and
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P \& A \\

            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)

        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    where every small square, and therefore rectangle, commutes.

    These diagrams gives rise to the following commutative diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2.7cm} {
                \Omega A \& P \& A \\

                    edge node {\phi_1^B \circ f - \Sigma' \circ \Omega'(f) \circ \phi_1^A} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node[swap] {\kappa_{\Omega B}} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node[swap] {\rho_{\Omega B}} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    where from the cokernel property of \( A \), one gets an induced morphism \( \theta \), and from the epimorphism property of \( \pi_A \), it makes the lower triangle commute. And since \( R \) is assumed to be a Frobenius ring, this implies that every injective module over \( R \) is projective and vice versa. This implies
    \[
        \phi_1^B \circ f \sim \Sigma' \circ \Omega'(f) \circ \phi_1^A,
    \]
    which means that \( [\phi_1] \) is a natural isomorphism from \( \Id_{\Mc} \) to \( \Sigma \Omega \), with inverse \( [\phi_2] \).
\end{proof}

An interesting consequence of how \( \Omega \) and \( \Sigma \) are defined is that if one were to chose a different \( P \) or \( I \) in their definitions, then it would yield different, but naturally isomorphic functors. A proof of this statement for \( \Sigma \) can be found in \cite[Remark on p. 13]{Happel_1988}, with the proof for \( \Omega \) being dual.

Before one can show the triangulation of \( \Mc \), one first needs to define the cone of a morphism. The definition of a cone, as well as the definition of the distinguished triangles leans heavily upon \cite[Chapter 1, Subsection 2.5]{Happel_1988}.

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:stmod_cone}
    Let \( f \in \Mod(R)(A, B) \).
    
    Then define a \emph{cone of \( f \)} to be an object \( C_f \) from the following commutative diagram in \( \Mod(R) \)
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& B \\
                I_A \& C_f \\
                \& \Sigma A \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {f} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\kappa_A} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge node {g} (m-2-2)
                    edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {0} (m-3-2)

                (m-2-1) edge node {\gamma_f} (m-2-2)
                    edge node {\rho_A} (m-3-2)
                (m-2-2) edge node {h} (m-3-2);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    where \( \tuple{I_A, \kappa_A, \Sigma A} \) is as defined in \autoref{def:stmod_sigma}. Furthermore, \( \tuple{C_f, g, \gamma_f} \) is the pushout of \( \tuple{A, f, \kappa_A} \), and \( h \) is the pushout universal property induced by \( \rho_A \) and \( 0 \).
\end{definition}

There are some important details following this definition that will be useful in future results.

\begin{remark}
    \label{rem:stmod_cone_pushout_properties}
    Use the notation and morphisms from \autoref{def:stmod_cone}.

    By known pushout facts, it follows that since \( \kappa_A \) is a monomorphism, then \( g \) is a monomorphism since \( \ker(g) = \ker(\kappa_A) = 0 \). Likewise it follows that \( \coker(g) \cong \coker(\kappa_A) \cong \Sigma A \), and therefore \( h \) is a cokernel morphism for \( \alpha \).
\end{remark}

Now, one can finally define the triangulation on \( \Mc \).

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:stmod_delta}
    Let \( \Delta \) be the collection of triangles in \( \Mc \) isomorphic to any triangle of the form
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& B \& C_f \& \Sigma A \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {[f]} (m-1-2)
                (m-1-2) edge node {[g]} (m-1-3)
                (m-1-3) edge node {[h]} (m-1-4);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    where \( C_f \), \( g \), and \( h \) are defined as in \autoref{def:stmod_cone}.
\end{definition}

A small detail that is important to consider, but which will turn out to be a non-issue is the following.
\begin{remark}
    Since morphisms in \( \Mc \) are residue classes and can therefore have multiple representatives, the definition of the cone of a morphism in \( \Mc \), is not well defined, since every morphism could have multiple cones depending on the choice of representatives. This is not a problem in this thesis, since by the formulation of \( \Delta \), any standard triangle arising from any representation of \( [f] \) is included in \( \Delta \), and so there are multiple ``standard triangles'' for every morphism in \( \Mc \).

    However, for brevity, the thesis will still refer to ``the'' standard triangle for a morphism in \( \Mc \), which will be any triangle as defined in \autoref{def:stmod_delta}.
\end{remark}

The following lemma is neccesary in proving {\bf (TR4)}, however, it has as a direct corollary that one could have chosen \( \Delta \) differently.
\begin{lemma}
    Let
    \[

                    I \& C \\
                };
    
                \draw[math]
                    (m-1-1) edge node {f} (m-1-2)
                        edge node {g} (m-2-1)
                    (m-1-2) edge node {g'} (m-2-2)

    be two pushout squares in \( \Mod(R) \), with \( g \) and \( h \) monomorphisms into injective objects \( I \) and \( I' \).

    Then \( C \cong C' \) in \( \Mc \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Since both \( I \) and \( I' \) are injective objects and \( g \) and \( h \) monomorphisms, then there exists maps \( i \) and \( i' \) such that the following two diagrams commute
    \[
        \begin{aligned}

    \]
    Using those morphisms, one can create the following commutative diagram, where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are the induced morphisms from the pushout property of \( C \) and \( C' \) respectively, 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}

        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    The goal is to show that \( \beta \circ \alpha \sim \Id_C \).

    By definition of a pushout, the following squence is exact

    Consider the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrow

                        edge node {\beta \circ \alpha - \Id_C} (m-2-3)

                    (m-2-2) edge node {\gamma} (m-2-3);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    since
    \[
        \begin{psmallmatrix}
            0 & i' \circ i - \Id_I
        \end{psmallmatrix}
        \circ
        \begin{psmallmatrix}
            f \\
            g
        \end{psmallmatrix}
        = 0
    \]
    then by the cokernel property of \( C \) there exist a morphism \( \delta \) such that the top triangle in \autoref{diag:C-iso} commutes. However, since \( 
        \begin{psmallmatrix}
            g' & \gamma
        \end{psmallmatrix}
    \) is an epimorphism by definition, it follows that the bottom triangle also commutes.

    One can prove that \( \alpha \circ \beta \sim \Id_{C'} \) in a similar way.
\end{proof}

Then finally comes the full triangulation result, the proof of which is heavily inspired by \cite[First theorem in Chapter 1, Subsection 2.6]{Happel_1988}.

% TODO: Kommenter at den nøyaktige triangulerte strukturen ikkje blir brukt seinare i oppgåva. Etterpå vert berre eksistensen av ein triangulering brukt.

            With the above diagrams in mind, consider the following commutative diagram
            \begin{center}

            where \( \phi \) is given by the pushout universal property.

            Consider the following equalities that follow from the above commutative diagrams
            \[
                \rho_B \circ \phi \circ g = \rho_B \circ \kappa_B = 0 = \Sigma'(f) \circ h \circ g,

            and
            \[
                \rho_B \circ \phi \circ \gamma_f = \rho_B \circ i_f = \Sigma'(f) \circ \rho_A = \Sigma'(f) \circ h \circ \gamma_f.
            \]
            This implies that considering the following pushout diagram
            \begin{center}

            would have two different morphisms, \( \rho_B \circ \phi \) and \( \Sigma'(f) \circ h \), that could satisfy the pushout universal property. However, by uniqueness, they therefore have to be the same morphism, i.e,
            \[
                \rho_B \circ \phi = \Sigma'(f) \circ h.
            \]

            where the top row is exact by \autoref{rem:stmod_cone_pushout_properties}, and the second row is split-exact. Since the top right square commutes, it follows that equality is the induced cokernel morphism for \( \coker(g) = \Sigma A \), and since \( \zeta = 0 \) is an epimorphism, it follows that the middle square is in fact a pushout, which implies \( I_B \oplus \Sigma A  \) is uniquely isomorphic to \( C_g \). % TODO: Cite Notat, klassifisering av pushout og pullback i abelsk kategori.

            The left and the middle square commute directly, but it remains to check if the right square commutes. In addition one needs to check that \( \class{

            } \) is an isomorphism.

            First, check the commutativity. Consider the difference
            \[

                -
                -\Sigma'(f) \circ

                \end{psmallmatrix}
                =
                \begin{psmallmatrix}
                    \rho_B & -\Sigma' f
                \end{psmallmatrix}
                +
                \begin{psmallmatrix}
                    0 & \Sigma' f
                \end{psmallmatrix}
                =
                \begin{psmallmatrix}

                \end{psmallmatrix}.
            \]
            One can see that the diagram

                        } (m-1-3)
                            edge node {
                                \begin{psmallmatrix}

                        (m-2-2) edge node {\rho_B} (m-1-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            commutes, and since every injective module is also projective by definition of Frobenius ring, the right hand square above commutes.

            Second, check that \( \class{

            then since \( [f'] \circ [\alpha] = [\beta] \circ [f] \) in \( \Mc \), one has that \( f' \circ \alpha - \beta \circ f \) factors through a projective. However, since projectives are injectives, then by the universal property of injective objects applied to \( \kappa_A \), it follows that \( f' \circ \alpha - \beta \circ f \) factors through \( \kappa_A \) and that there is some morphism \( \xi: I_A \to B' \) such that
            \[
                f' \circ \alpha - \beta \circ f = \xi \circ \kappa_A.

            Since
            \begin{align*}
                g' \circ \beta \circ f &= g' \circ f' \circ \alpha + g' \circ \xi \circ \kappa_A \\

            \end{align*}

            By the commutativity of the pushout diagram, the middle square of \autoref{eq:stablemod} commutes. Then it remains to check if \( [h' \circ \phi] = [\Sigma' (\alpha) \circ h] \).

            implies that there are two choices of dashed line in the above diagram that would make it commute. However, by uniqueness, this implies they are equal and so

            The goal is to find appropriate \( \phi \) and \( \psi \) as well as to slightly change the above diagram to one that would commute in \( \Mc \). 

            By the \emph{construction} of \( \phi \) in {\bf (TR3)} there exists some \( \phi: C_f \to C_{n \circ f} \) such that the diagram including \( \phi \) commutes. However note that the \( \xi \) in the construction of \( \phi \) is simply \( 0 \) because here the diagram is in \( \Mod(R) \), and not in \( \Mc \) as is assumed in the construction in {\bf (TR3)}. Similarly, \( i_\alpha = i_{\Id_A} \) can be assumed to simply be \( \Id_{I_A} \). Specifically this implies that \( \phi \circ \gamma_f = \gamma_{n \circ f} \).

            By \autoref{rem:stmod_cone_pushout_properties} it follows that \( g \) is a monomorphism. And since \( \kappa_{C_f} \) is also a monomorphism, it follows that
            \[
                \kappa_{C_f} \circ g: B \to I_{C_f}
            \]
            is also a monomorphism. Then by the injective object property of \( (\kappa_B, I_B) \) there exist some morphism \( i: I_{C_f} \to I_B \) which makes the following diagram excluding the dashed arrow commutes
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}

                        I_{C_f} \& I_B. \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-2) edge node[swap] {\kappa_{C_f} \circ g} (m-2-1)
                            edge node {\kappa_B} (m-2-2)

                        (m-2-1) edge node {i} (m-2-2)
                        (m-2-2) edge[dashed, curve={height=-25pt}] node {\tilde{i}} (m-2-1);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            By the same argument, there exists some \( \tilde{i} \) such that the above diagram excluding \( i \) commutes.
            
            Consider the following pushout diagram of \( C_{n \circ f} \)
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        A \& D \\
                        I_A \& C_{n \circ f} \\
                        \& \& C_n, \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge node {n \circ f} (m-1-2)
                            edge node {\kappa_A} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge node {j} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {m} (m-3-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge node {\gamma_{n \circ f}} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=25pt}] node[swap] {\gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f} (m-3-3)
                        (m-2-2) edge[dashed] node {\psi} (m-3-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            and note that the outer ``square'' commutes as
            \begin{align*}
                m \circ n \circ f &= \gamma_n \circ \kappa_B \circ f \\
                &= \gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ g \circ f \\
                &= \gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f \circ \kappa_A. \\
            \end{align*}
            Thus there exists a morphism \( \psi: C_{n \circ f} \to C_n \) such that the pushout diagram commutes.

            To show that \( \psi \) makes \autoref{eq:stmod_tr4} commute in \( \Mc \), one can see that the square to the left of \( \psi \) commutes by definition, however the square on the right is a little more tricky.

            Consider the following commutative diagram
            \begin{center}

                        \Sigma A \& \& \& \Sigma B \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]

                        (m-1-4) edge node {\kappa_B} (m-2-4)
                            edge node[swap] {g} (m-2-2)

                        (m-2-1) edge node {\gamma_f} (m-2-2)
                            edge node {\rho_A} (m-3-1)
                        (m-2-2) edge node[swap] {\kappa_{C_f}} (m-2-3)
                        (m-2-3) edge node {i} (m-2-4)
                        (m-2-4) edge node {\rho_B} (m-3-4)

                        (m-3-1) edge node {\widetilde{\Sigma' f}} (m-3-4);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            where the top square commutes because the top left and top right ``triangles'' of the diagram commute, and \( \widetilde{\Sigma' f} \) is given by the cokernel property of \( \Sigma A \). Then by \autoref{lem:stmod_sigma_well-defined_additive_endofunctor} it follows that \( \widetilde{\Sigma' f} \sim \Sigma' f \).

            Then consider the following diagram in \( \Mod(R) \)
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        A \& D \\
                        I_A \& C_{n \circ f} \\
                        \& \& \Sigma B \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge node {n \circ f} (m-1-2)
                            edge node {\kappa_A} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge node {j} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {0} (m-3-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge node {\gamma_{n \circ f}} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=25pt}] node[swap] {k \circ \gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f} (m-3-3)
                        (m-2-2) edge[dashed] (m-3-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            where one can check that
            \[
                \widetilde{\Sigma'(f)} \circ l \circ j = \widetilde{\Sigma'(f)} \circ 0 = 0 = k \circ m = k \circ \psi \circ j
            \]
            and so
            \begin{align*}
                k \circ \psi \circ \gamma_{n \circ f} &= k \circ \gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f \\
                &= \rho_B \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f \\
                &= \widetilde{\Sigma'(f)} \circ \rho_A \\
                &= \widetilde{\Sigma'(f)} \circ l \circ \gamma_{n \circ f}.
            \end{align*}
            By uniqueness of the pushout property and definition of \( \widetilde{\Sigma'(f)} \), one has that \( k \circ \psi = \widetilde{\Sigma'(f)} \circ l \sim \Sigma'(f) \circ l \).
                
            Therefore the square to the right of \( \psi \) commutes in \( \Mc \), but not in \( \Mod(R) \).

            Finally, it remains to check that
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}

            Since the left and the outer square are pushouts this implies that the right square is also a pushout.

By \cite[Lemma, Subsection 7.5]{Krause_2007} it follows that \( \Mc \) is in fact what one calls a \emph{algebraic triangulated category}. This will be touched on later in the thesis. % TODO: Specify where it will be touched on and the connection between Krause and Jasso-Muro's definition.
