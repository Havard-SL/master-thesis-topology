% TODO: Kan generaliserast til endeleg gen modular om R er noetherske. Og det verkar som frobenius ringar er noetherske. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-Frobenius_ring Zimmermann: Prop. 5.1.4

A triangulated ctageory that will be central in this thesis is the stable module category. Therefore the definition will be given in more details than the previous two examples of triangulated categories.

Before showing the triangulated structure, it is as usual necessary to define the underlying category first. However, the underlying category require some lemmas to be well defined.

First, a small lemma that will be used to define the morphisms in the stable module category.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:morphisms_factoring_through_projectives_r-submodule}
    Let \( R \) be a commutative ring with identity.

    Let \( G \) be the subset of \( \Mod(R)(A, B) \) consisting of module morphisms that factor through a projective object.

    Then \( G \) is an \( R \)-submodule of \( \Mod(R)(A, B) \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let \( f \) and \( g \) be two morphisms that factor through the projectives \( P \) and \( Q \) respectively. Then we have the following diagrams.

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& P \& B \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {f_1} (m-1-2)
                (m-1-2) edge node {f_2} (m-1-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    where \( f_2 \circ f_1 = f \), and
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& Q \& B, \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {g_1} (m-1-2)
                (m-1-2) edge node {g_2} (m-1-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    where \( g_2 \circ g_1 = g \).

    One can then construct the morphism
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& {P \oplus Q} \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {
                    \begin{psmallmatrix}
                        f_1 \\
                        g_1
                    \end{psmallmatrix}
                } (m-1-2)
                (m-1-2) edge node {(f_2, g_2)} (m-1-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Composing these two morphisms, one gets the morphism \( f_2 \circ f_1 + g_2 \circ g_1 = f + g \). This morphisms factors thorugh \( P \oplus Q \), which is projective since it's a direct sum of projective modules.

    Therefore, the set of homomorphisms that factor through a projective is closed under addition. And multiplying with a ring element still factors through the same projective, since every morphism is an \( R \) homomorphism. Therefore the set of morphisms that factor through a projective is an \( R \) submodule.
\end{proof}

From now on, in this subsection let \( \Mod(R)(A, B)/G \), with \( R \) a commutative ring with identity, simply be denoted as \( \widetilde{\Mc}(A, B) \).

Second is the result that makes composition in the stable module category well defined.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_composition_well-defined}
    Define the binary operation \( c \) as follows
    \begin{align*}
        c: \widetilde{\Mc}(B, C) \times \widetilde{\Mc}(A, B) &\to \widetilde{\Mc}(A, C) \\
        [g] \times [f] &\mapsto [g \circ f]
    \end{align*}

    Then \( c \) is well defined.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Need to check that two different choices of representatives of \( [f] \) and \( [g] \) yields the same value.

    Let \( [f + \widetilde{f}] \) and \( [g + \widetilde{g}] \) be two different representatives of \( [f] \) and \( [g] \), with \( \widetilde{f} \) and \( \widetilde{g} \) factoring through some projectives.

    Then it follows that
    \[
        [f + \widetilde{f}] \circ [g + \widetilde{g}] = [f \circ g] + [\widetilde{f} \circ g] + [f \circ \widetilde{g}] + [\widetilde{f} \circ \widetilde{g}].
    \]
    
    Every term other than \( [f \circ g] \) factors through a projective and is therefore equal to \( 0 \) in \( \widetilde{\Mc}(A, C) \).
\end{proof}

Finally one can define the underlying stable module category.

% TODO: Frobenius algebra for sterk antaking?
\begin{definition}
    \label{def:stable_module_category}
    Let \( R \) be a \emph{frobenius ring}.

    Then the \emph{stable module category over \( R \)}, denoted \( \Mc \) in this thesis, is defined in the following way:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {
            The objects are infinitely generated modules over \( R \).
        }
        \item {
            Then
            \[
                \Mc(A, B) := \widetilde{\Mc}(A, B)
            \]
        }
        \item {
            For two morphisms \( [g] \in \Mc(B, C) \), and \( [f] \in \Mc(A, B) \), let composition be defined as follows
            \[
                [g] \circ [f] := [g \circ f].
            \]
        }
    \end{enumerate}

    This category is called the \emph{infinitely generated stable module category over \( R \)}.
\end{definition}

Other authors typically use the notation \( \StMod(R) \) or \( \underline{\Mod}(R) \) for the stable module category. However, for the sake of clarity this is reduced to simply \( \Mc \) in this thesis.

In the general definition of the infinitely generated stable module category, it is not required that the ring is a frobenius ring. However, as will become apparent later in this subsection is that it is a requirement to having a triangulated structure defined on it. Since this thesis will only be considering the stable module category as a triangulated category, this assumption is made from the beginning.
% TODO: Faktasjekk, er det verkeleg sant at Frobenius er naudsynt? Las eg ikkje ein stad at nok injektiv og projektive og dei samanfaller er godt nok?

In order to be an underlying category of a triangulated category, a category needs to be additive.

\begin{lemma}
    \( \Mc \) is an additive category.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    There are two parts to this proof. First want to show that \( \Mc \) is pre-additive and then second, want to show that \( \Mc \) has finite products which in addition to being pre-additive would imply that \( \Mc \) is additive by TODO:Cite.
    % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_category

    To show that \( \Mc \) is pre-additive there are two properties that need to be shown
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {
            First, need to show that for any \( A, B \in \Mc \) that \( \Mc(A, B) \) is an abelian group.

            This follows immediately, since \( \Mc(A, B) \) is the quotient of an \( R \)-module, and is therefore an \( R \)-module and hence an abelian group.
        }
        \item {
            Second, need to show that composition is bilinear.

            Consider \( [f], [f'] \in \Mc(B, C) \) and \( [g], [g'] \in \Mc(A, B) \). Consider the following equation
            \begin{align*}
                ([f] + [f']) \circ ([g] + [g']) &= [f + f'] \circ [g + g'] \\
                &= \class{(f + f') \circ (g + g')} \\
                &= \class{f \circ g + f \circ g' + f' \circ g + f' \circ g'} \\
                &= [f] \circ [g] + [f] \circ [g'] + [f'] \circ [g] + [f'] \circ [g'],
            \end{align*}
            which is exactly bilinearity.
        }
    \end{enumerate}

    The claim is that the usual biproduct in \( \Mod(R) \) is the product in \( \Mc \). Let the following be the commutative diagram for the universal property of \( A \oplus B \) as a product in \( \Mod(R) \), but in \( \Mc \) with respect to some object \( X \).
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1.5cm}{1.5cm} {
                \& X \\
                A \& A \oplus B \& B \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-2) edge node[swap] {[f_A]} (m-2-1)
                    edge[dashed] node {[f]} (m-2-2)
                    edge node {[f_B]} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-2) edge node[swap] {[\pi_B]} (m-2-3)
                    edge node {[\pi_A]} (m-2-1);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Let \( [g]: X \to A \times B \) be another morphism that satisfies the universal property.

    Then the following diagram commutes.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1.5cm}{1.5cm} {
                \& X \\
                A \& A \oplus B \& B \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-2) edge node[swap] {[0]} (m-2-1)
                    edge[dashed] node {[f - g]} (m-2-2)
                    edge node {[0]} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-2) edge node[swap] {[\pi_B]} (m-2-3)
                    edge node {[\pi_A]} (m-2-1);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Let \( \iota_A, \iota_B \) denote the canonical split monomorphisms from the universal property of the coproduct. Since \( A \oplus B \) is a biproduct in \( \Mod(R) \) one has the known fact that
    \[
        \Id_{A \oplus B} = \iota_A \circ \pi_A + \iota_B \circ \pi_B.
    \]
    Consider the following equation,
    \begin{align*}
        [f - g] &= [\Id_{A \oplus B} \circ (f - g)] \\
        &= [\iota_A \circ \pi_A \circ (f - g) + \iota_B \circ \pi_B \circ (f - g)] \\
        &= [\iota_A] \circ [\pi_A \circ (f - g)] + [\iota_B] \circ [\pi_B \circ (f - g)] \\
        &= [0].
    \end{align*}
    Which implies that \( [f] = [g] \), and that \( A \oplus B \) is a product in \( \Mc \), and by the statement at the start, also a biproduct.
\end{proof}

This thesis starts by defining the functor \( \Omega \), which will be shown later to be the inverse of the shift functor.

But in order to properly define \( \Omega \), a couple of prerequisites are needed first.

An important property of the category of modules over a commutative ring with identity is that it has \emph{enough projectives} and \emph{enough injectives}. Having enough projectives means that for any module \( A \), there exists some projective module \( P_A \) dependent on \( A \), as well as an epimimorphism, \( \pi_A \) from \( P_A \) to \( A \). The choice of \( P_A \) and \( \pi_A \) is \emph{not necessarily unique} and two different choices of \( P_A \) \emph{could be non-isomorphic}. Similarly, having enough injectives means that for any module \( A \) there exists some injective module \( I_A \) along with a monomorphism \( \iota_A \) from \( A \) to \( I_A \). Similar to the projective case, \( I_A \) and \( \iota_A \) are \emph{not necessarily unique potentially non-isomorphic}.

However, in defining \( \Omega \), the definition is closely tied to a choice of \( P_A \) and \( \pi_A \)-s. It is important that the definition is well defined, so a choice of projective objects and epimorphisms are made in advance. Also, the definition of \( \Omega \) is tied to the kernel of the choice of \( \pi_A \), and it therefore makes sense to fix a choice of kernel as well, since it is also not unique (only up to isomorphism).

% Similarly, let \( I \) be a collection of tuples of an injective module, a monomorphisms, and a module, where for any module \( B \in \Mod(R) \), there is some tuple \( \tuple{I_A, \iota_A, \Sigma A} \) such that \( \iota_A \) is a monomorphism from \( A \) to \( \iota_A \), and \( \Sigma A \) is a choice of cokernel of \( \iota_A \).

\begin{definition}[The functor \( \Omega \)]
    \label{def:stmod_omega}
    Since \( \Mod(R) \) has enough projectives, let \( P \) be a collection of tuples for every object \( A \) consisting of a projective module \( P_A \), an epimorphism \( \pi_A \), and a module \( \Omega A \), where \( \pi_A \) is an epimorphism from \( P_A \) to \( A \), and \( \Omega A \) is a kernel of \( \pi_A \).

    Then define \( \Omega \) as the assignment of objects and morphisms in \( \Mc \) as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {
            For any object \( A \) in \( \Mc \), let \( \Omega A \) be as defined in \( P \) above.
        }
        \item {
            For any \( [f] \in \Mc(A, B) \), let \( \Omega([f]) \) be constructed as follows:

            Consider the following diagram in \( \Mod(R) \), with the relevant objects and morphisms from \( P \) defined above
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                        {\Omega B} \& {P_B} \& B. \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                            edge node {\Omega' f} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                            edge node {p_f} (m-2-2)
                        (m-1-3) edge node {f} (m-2-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                        (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}

            One has that for a morphism \( f: A \to B \), there exists a morphism \( p_f \) from the lifitng property of projective modules such that the right square commutes. Please note that the choice of \( p_f \) is \emph{not neccesarily unique}.

            Furthermore, since
            \[
                \pi_B \circ p_f \circ \iota_A = f \circ \pi_A \circ \iota_A = f \circ 0 = 0,
            \]
            one has from the universal kernel property that there exists a unique morphism, dependent on the choice of \( p_f \), denoted as \( \Omega'(f) \) from \( \Omega A \) to \( \Omega B \) such that the left square in the above diagram commutes. Taking the equivalence class of this morphism with respect to morphisms factoring through projectctives yields the morphism defined by the assignment, i.e. \( \Omega [f] := \class{\Omega'(f)} \).
        }
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The goal is to show that the above assignment is a well defined endofunctor, and later showing that it is in fact an additive autoequivalence of categories.

The following is the lemma showing that \( \Omega \) is a well-defined assignment of morphisms.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_omega_f_is_well_defined}
    \( \Omega \) is a well-defined assignment of morphisms.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    There are two things that need to be proven. First, in the construction of \( \Omega'(f) \), one has to choose a morphism \( p_f \) from the projective property. Needs to show that if one choses another projective morphism, that \( \Omega \) still yields the same morphism in \( \Mc \). Second, one need to show that if \( f \sim g \), then \( \Omega'(f) \sim \Omega'(g) \).

    To prove the first part, let \( p_f \) and \( \widetilde{p_f} \) be two different projective morphisms that give the morphisms \( \Omega'(f) \) and \( \widetilde{\Omega'(f)} \) respectively. Then one has the following commutative diagram excluding the dotted arrow
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega B} \& {P_B} \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Omega'(f) - \widetilde{\Omega'(f)}} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge[dashed, swap] node {\phi} (m-2-1)
                    edge node {p_f - \widetilde{p_f}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {f -f = 0} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Since
    \[
        \pi_B \circ \tuple{p_f - \widetilde{p_f}} = \tuple{f - f} \circ \pi_A = 0
    \]
    there exists a morphism \( \phi \) induced by the kernel property of \( \Omega B \), such that the lower triangle in the diagram commutes. However, since \( \iota_B \) is a monomorphism, one also gets that the upper triangle commutes. This implies that the morphism \( \Omega'(f) - \widetilde{\Omega'(f)} \) factors through \( P_A \), a projective module. Therefore
    \[
        0 = \class{\Omega'(f) - \widetilde{\Omega'(f)}} = \class{\Omega'(f)} - \class{\widetilde{\Omega'(f)}}
    \]
    which implies \( \Omega [f] \) is independent of choice of \( p_f \).

    Second, needs to show that if \( f \sim g \), then \( \Omega f \sim \Omega g \). Consider the following diagram

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{3cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \&\& P \\
                \Omega B \& P_B \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge node {\Omega'(f) - \Omega'(g)} (m-3-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node {p_f - p_g} (m-3-2)
                (m-1-3) edge[swap] node {(f - g)_1} (m-2-3)
                    edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {f - g} (m-3-3)

                (m-2-3) edge[swap, dashed, color={rgb,255:red,214;green,92;blue,92}] node {\theta} (m-3-2)
                    edge[swap] node {(f - g)_2} (m-3-3)

                (m-3-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_B} (m-3-2)
                (m-3-2) edge[two heads] node[swap] {\pi_B} (m-3-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Let \( P \) be the projective that \( f - g \) factors through. Then from the projective property, there exists a morphism \( \theta: P \to P_B \), which causes the lower triangle to commute.

    Let \( p'_{f - g} := \theta \circ (f - g)_1 \circ \pi_A \). By construction, one has that both \( p_f - p_g \) and \( p'_{f - g} \) are morphisms that would make the right hand square commute.
    
    But since
    \[
        p'_{f - g} \circ \iota_A = \theta \circ (f-g)_1 \circ \pi_A \circ \iota_A = \theta \circ (f-g)_1 \circ 0 = 0,
    \]
    it implies that if the leftmost morphism in the diagram was \( 0 \) and the middle morphism was \( p'_{f - g} \), it would commute. By the previous part of this proof, since the two possible middle morphisms, \( p_f - p_g \) and \( p'_{f - g} \), produce two different leftmost morphisms \( \Omega'(f) - \Omega'(g) \) and \( 0 \), one has that \( \Omega [f] = \Omega [g] \).
\end{proof}

Now that \( \Omega \) is a well defined asssignment of objects and morphisms, it only remains to prove functoriality as well as showing that the identity is mapped to the identity to show that it's a functor.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_omega_endofunctor}
    \( \Omega \) is an endofunctor on \( \Mc \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    To show that \( \Omega \) is a functor it remains to prove functoriality as well as showing that the identity is mapped to the identity.

    First want to show that \( \Omega \) is functorial. Let \( A, B, C \in \Mc \). Then by the definition of \( \Omega \), one has the following commutative diagram

    \end{center}

    Considering the composition of the vertical morphisms, one ends up with the following commutative diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega C} \& {P_C} \& C. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Omega'(f) \circ \Omega'(g)} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node {p_f \circ p_g} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {f \circ g} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_C} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_C} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Since \( \Omega \) is a well-defined assignment of morphisms, this implies
    \[
        \Omega([f]) \circ \Omega([g]) = \class{\Omega'(f) \circ \Omega'(g)} = \Omega \class{f \circ g}.
    \]

    Second, need to show that \( \Omega \Id_A = \Id_{\Omega A} \) in \( \Mc \).

    By a similar argument to above, one can see that every square and triangle in the following diagram commutes
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Id_{\Omega A}} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] (m-1-3)
                    edge node {\Id_{P_A}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {\Id_A} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Therefore \( \Omega \class{\Id_A} = \class{\Id_{\Omega A}} \).
\end{proof}

An important detail still missing to show that \( \Omega^{-1} \) could be a shift functor is showing that \( \Omega \) is additive.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_omega_additive_functor}
    \( \Omega \) is an additive functor.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Want to show that \( \Omega(f + g) \sim \Omega(f) + \Omega(g) \).
    
    There are two posssible values of \( \Omega'(f + g) \), namely the ones from either of the two commutative diagrams below
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega B} \& {P_B} \& B \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Omega'(f+g)} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node[swap] {p_{f + g}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node[swap] {f + g} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega B} \& {P_B} \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Omega'(f)+\Omega'(g)} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node[swap] {p_f + p_g} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node[swap] {f + g} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Since \( \Omega [f + g] \) is well defined, this implies \( \Omega [f + g] = \Omega([f]) + \Omega([g]) \).
\end{proof}

Now that \( \Omega \) has been shown to be an additive functor, one can define \( \Sigma \) which will turn out to be the inverse of \( \Omega \) later.

\begin{definition}[The functor \( \Sigma \)]
    \label{def:stmod_sigma}
    Since \( \Mod(R) \) has enough projectives, let \( I \) be a collection of tuples for every object \( A \) consisting of an injective module \( I_A \), an monomorphism \( \pi_A \), and a module \( \Sigma A \), where \( \iota_A \) is an monomorphism from \( A \) to \( P_A \), and \( \Sigma A \) is a cokernel of \( \iota_A \).

    Then define \( \Sigma \) as the assignment of objects and morphisms in \( \Mc \) as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {
            For any object \( A \) in \( \Mc \), let \( \Sigma A \) be as defined in \( I \) above.
        }
        \item {
            \( \Sigma [f] \) is constructed as follows:

            Consider the following diagram in \( \Mod(R) \)
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        A \& I_A \& \Sigma A \\
                        B \& I_B \& \Sigma B. \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\kappa_A} (m-1-2)
                            edge node {f} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\rho_A} (m-1-3)
                            edge node {i_f} (m-2-2)
                        (m-1-3) edge node {\Sigma'(f)} (m-2-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\kappa_B} (m-2-2)
                        (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\rho_B} (m-2-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}

            One has that for a morphism \( f: A \to B \), there exists a morphism \( i_f \) from the universal property of injective objects such that the left square commutes. Please note that this morphism is \emph{not neccesarily} unique.

            Furthermore, since
            \[
                \kappa_B \circ i_f \circ \rho_A = \kappa_B \circ \rho_B \circ f = 0,
            \]
            one has from the universal cokernel property that there exists a unique morphism, dependant on the choice of \( i_f \), denoted as \( \Sigma'(f) \) from \( \Sigma A \) to \( \Sigma B \) such that the right square in the above diagram commutes. Taking the equivalence class of this morphism with respect to morphisms factoring through projectives yields the morphism defined by the functor, i.e. \( \Sigma [f] := \class{\Sigma'(f)} \).
        }
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Now it remains to show every desired property of \( \Omega \), like being a well-defined, an endofunctor, and additive. However, that is a lot of work, that can luckily be skipped because of the previous legwork on proving the respective properties for \( \Omega \).

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_sigma_well-defined_additive_endofunctor}
    \( \Sigma \) is a well-defined and additive endofunctor on \( \Mc \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The proofs of the various statements are entirely dual to the proofs of \autoref{lem:stmod_omega_f_is_well_defined}, \autoref{lem:stmod_omega_endofunctor} and \autoref{lem:stmod_omega_additive_functor}.
\end{proof}

Now one can finally show that \( \Sigma = \Omega^{-1} \).

\begin{theorem}
    \( \Omega \) is an auto equivalence with inverse \( \Sigma \).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    This thesis will only show that \( \Id_{\Mc} \) is naturally isomorphic to \( \Sigma\Omega \). The omitted part that \( \Id_{\Mc} \) is naturally isomorphic to \( \Omega\Sigma \) is very similar, and uses many dual properties.

    First show that for any \( A \in \Mc \), there exist an isomorphism from \( A \to \Sigma\Omega A \). Consider the following diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \Omega A \& I_{\Omega A} \& \Sigma \Omega A \\
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A, \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[equal] (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node {i_{\phi_1}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {\phi_1} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\kappa_{\Omega A}} (m-2-2)
                    edge[equal] (m-3-1)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\rho_{\Omega A}} (m-2-3)
                    edge node {i_{\phi_2}} (m-3-2)
                (m-2-3) edge node {\phi_2} (m-3-3)

                (m-3-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-3-2)
                (m-3-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-3-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    where \( i_{\phi_1} \) is the injective property morphism induced from \( \iota_A \). Then since \( \Mod(R) \) is an abelian category, \( A \) is a cokernel of \( \iota_A \), and by
    \[
        \rho_{\Omega A} \circ i_{\phi_1} \circ \iota_A = \rho_{\Omega A} \circ \kappa_{\Omega A} = 0,
    \]
    one gets from the cokernel property that there is a uniquely induced morphism \( \phi_1: A \to \Sigma\Omega A \). Then doing the same for the lower rectangle of the diagram, using the fact that every projective is also injective, then one gets the morphisms \( i_{\phi_2} \) and \( \phi_2 \) by similar arguments.

    Then to show that \( \phi_1 \) and \( \phi_2 \) are isomorphisms, consider the following diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Id_{\Omega A} \circ \Id_{\Omega A} - \Id_{\Omega A} = 0} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge[swap] node {i_{\phi_2} \circ i_{\phi_1} - \Id_P} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge[swap, color={rgb,255:red,214;green,92;blue,92}] node {\theta} (m-2-2)
                    edge node {\phi_2 \circ \phi_1 - \Id_A} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[hook] node {\iota_A} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two heads] node {\pi_A} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Using the previous commutative diagram, one gets that every square commutes. But since
    \[
        (p_{\phi_2} \circ p_{\phi_1} - \Id_{P_A}) \circ \iota_A = \iota_A \circ 0 = 0,
    \]
    then from the cokernel property there exist a morphism \( \theta: A \to P_A \) such that the upper triangle commutes. But then one has that
    \[
        (\phi_2 \circ \phi_1 - \Id_A) \circ \pi_A = \pi_A \circ (p_{\theta_2} \circ p_{\theta_1} - \Id_P) = \pi_A \circ \theta \circ \pi_A,
    \]
    and since \( \pi_A \) is an epimorphism, one gets that the lower triangle commutes. This implies that \( \phi_2 \circ \phi_1 \sim \Id_A \).
    
    By a similar agument that is omitted for brevity, one can show that \( \phi_1 \circ \phi_2 \sim \Id_{\Sigma\Omega A} \), which means that \( \phi_1 \) and \( \phi_2 \) are isomorphisms from \( A \) to \( \Sigma\Omega A \).

    To show that these isomorphisms are natural, let \( f \in \Mod(R)(A, B) \) and consider the following two diagrams
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P \& A \\
                \Omega A \& I \& \Sigma \Omega A \\
                \Omega B \& I \& \Sigma \Omega B, \\
            };

    and

    where from the cokernel property of \( A \), one gets an induced morphism \( \theta \), and from the epimorphism property of \( \pi_A \), it makes the lower triangle commute, which implies
    \[
        \phi_1^B \circ f \sim \Sigma\Omega(f) \circ \phi_1^A,
    \]
    which means that \( \phi_1 \) is a natural isomorphism from \( \Id_{\Mc} \) to \( \Sigma \Omega \), with inverse \( \phi_2 \).
\end{proof}
