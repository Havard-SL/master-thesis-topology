A triangulated category that will be central in this thesis is the stable module category. Therefore, the definition will be given in more details than the previous two examples of triangulated categories.

% TODO: Marius vil definera projektive objekt. Overkill?
Before defining the stable module category, we prove a lemma that will be used to define the morphisms.
\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:morphisms_factoring_through_projectives_r-submodule}
    Let \( R \) be a commutative ring with identity.

    Let \( G \) be the subset of \( \Mod(R)(A, B) \) consisting of module morphisms that factor through a projective module.

    Then \( G \) is an \( R \)-submodule of \( \Mod(R)(A, B) \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let \( f \) and \( g \) be two morphisms that factor through the projective objects \( P \) and \( Q \), respectively. Then we have the following commutative diagrams
    \[
        \begin{aligned}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                    A \& P \& B \\
                };
    
                \draw[math]
                    (m-1-1) edge node {f_1} (m-1-2)
                        edge[curve={height=25pt}] node[swap] {f} (m-1-3)
                    (m-1-2) edge node {f_2} (m-1-3);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{aligned}
        \text{ and }
        \begin{aligned}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                    A \& Q \& B. \\
                };
    
                \draw[math]
                    (m-1-1) edge node {g_1} (m-1-2)
                        edge[curve={height=25pt}] node[swap] {g} (m-1-3)
                    (m-1-2) edge node {g_2} (m-1-3);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{aligned}
    \]

    We can then construct the morphism
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& {P \oplus Q} \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {
                    \begin{psmallmatrix}
                        f_1 \\
                        g_1
                    \end{psmallmatrix}
                } (m-1-2)
                (m-1-2) edge node {(f_2, g_2)} (m-1-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Composing these two morphisms, we get the morphism \( f_2 \circ f_1 + g_2 \circ g_1 = f + g \). This morphism factors through \( P \oplus Q \), which is projective since it is a direct sum of projective modules. This implies that \( G \) is closed under addition.
    
    Let \( r \in R \). Then the following diagram commutes,
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& P \& B, \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {rf_1} (m-1-2)
                    edge[curve={height=25pt}] node[swap] {rf} (m-1-3)
                (m-1-2) edge node {f_2} (m-1-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    which implies that \( G \) is also closed under multiplication in \( R \).
\end{proof}

In order to get a triangulated category, we have to use a specific type of ring, as defined below.
\begin{definition}
    A commutative ring with identity is called a \emph{Frobenius ring}, if every injective module is projective, and vice versa.
\end{definition}

The following is the definition of the stable module category.
\begin{definition}
    \label{def:stable_module_category}
    Let \( R \) be a \emph{Frobenius ring}.

    Then the \emph{stable module category over \( R \)}, denoted \( \Mc \), is defined in the following way:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {
            The objects are modules over \( R \).
        }
        \item {
            For \( A, B \in \Mc \), let \( G \) be the \( R \)-submodule from \autoref{lem:morphisms_factoring_through_projectives_r-submodule}.
        
            Then let
            \[
                \Mc(A, B) := \Mod(R)(A, B)/G.
            \]
        }
        \item {
            For \( [g] \in \Mc(B, C) \), and \( [f] \in \Mc(A, B) \), let composition be defined as follows
            \[
                [g] \circ [f] := [g \circ f].
            \]
        }
    \end{enumerate}
    This category is called the \emph{stable module category over \( R \)}.
\end{definition}

Other authors typically use the notation \( \StMod(R) \) or \( \underline{\Mod}(R) \) for the stable module category. However, for the sake of brevity this is reduced to simply \( \Mc \) in this thesis.

By the following remark, composition in \autoref{def:stable_module_category} is well-defined.
\begin{remark}
    \label{rem:stmod_composition_well-defined}
    Composition in \autoref{def:stable_module_category} is well-defined.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
    We need to check that two different choices of representatives of \( [f] \) and \( [g] \) yield the same value.

    Let \( f + \widetilde{f} \) and \( g + \widetilde{g} \) be two different representatives of \( [f] \) and \( [g] \), with \( \widetilde{f} \) and \( \widetilde{g} \) factoring through some projective modules.

    Then it follows that
    \[
         [g + \widetilde{g}] \circ [f + \widetilde{f}] = [g \circ f] + [\widetilde{g} \circ f] + [g \circ \widetilde{f}] + [\widetilde{g} \circ \widetilde{f}].
    \]
    
    Every term other than \( [g \circ f] \) factors through a projective and is therefore equal to \( 0 \) in \( \Mc(A, C) \).
\end{proof}

In the general definition of the stable module category, it is not required that the ring is a Frobenius ring. However, as will become apparent later on, it is a requirement to have a triangulation. Since we will only be considering stable module categories which are triangulated, this assumption is made from the beginning.
% TODO: Faktasjekk, er det verkeleg sant at Frobenius er naudsynt? Las eg ikkje ein stad at nok injektiv og projektive og dei samanfaller er godt nok?

In order to admit a triangulation, we need to prove that the stable module category is additive.

% TODO: Forenkla beviset, biprodukt argumentet spesielt. Ikkje 100% sikker på at Mac Lane seier det eg ynskjer, berre 80%ish.
\begin{lemma}
    \( \Mc \) is an additive category.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    There are two parts to this proof. First, we show that \( \Mc \) is pre-additive and second, we show that \( \Mc \) has finite products which in addition to being pre-additive would imply that \( \Mc \) is additive by \cite[p. 251]{Mac_Lane_1995}.

    To show that \( \Mc \) is pre-additive there are two properties that need to be shown
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item {
            First, we show that for any \( A, B \in \Mc \) that \( \Mc(A, B) \) is an abelian group.

            This follows immediately from the definition, since \( \Mc(A, B) \) is a quotient module, and is therefore an \( R \)-module and, hence, an abelian group.
        }
        \item {
            Second, we show that composition is bilinear.

            Consider \( [g], [g'] \in \Mc(B, C) \) and \( [f], [f'] \in \Mc(A, B) \). Consider the following equation
            \begin{align*}
                ([g] + [g']) \circ ([f] + [f']) &= [g + g'] \circ [f + f'] \\
                &= \class{(g + g') \circ (f + f')} \\
                &= \class{g \circ f + g \circ f' + g' \circ f + g' \circ f'} \\
                &= [g] \circ [f] + [g] \circ [f'] + [g'] \circ [f] + [g'] \circ [f'],
            \end{align*}
            which is precisely bilinearity.
        }
    \end{enumerate}

    The claim is that the usual biproduct in \( \Mod(R) \) induces the product in \( \Mc \).
    
    Consider the commutative diagram for the universal property of \( A \oplus B \) as a product in \( \Mod(R) \). Taking residue classes of the morphisms yields the following commutative diagram in \( \Mc \),
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1.5cm}{1.5cm} {
                \& X \\
                A \& A \oplus B \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-2) edge node[swap] {[f_A]} (m-2-1)
                    edge[dashed] node {[f]} (m-2-2)
                    edge node {[f_B]} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-2) edge node[swap] {[\pi_B]} (m-2-3)
                    edge node {[\pi_A]} (m-2-1);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Let \( [g]: X \to A \oplus B \) be another morphism that satisfies the universal property.

    Then the following diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1.5cm}{1.5cm} {
                \& X \\
                A \& A \oplus B \& B \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-2) edge node[swap] {[0]} (m-2-1)
                    edge[dashed] node {[f - g]} (m-2-2)
                    edge node {[0]} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-2) edge node[swap] {[\pi_B]} (m-2-3)
                    edge node {[\pi_A]} (m-2-1);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    commutes.

    Let \( \iota_A \), and \( \iota_B \) denote the canonical split monomorphisms from the universal property of the coproduct. Since \( A \oplus B \) is a biproduct in \( \Mod(R) \), we have
    \[
        \Id_{A \oplus B} = \iota_A \circ \pi_A + \iota_B \circ \pi_B.
    \]
    Thus,
    \begin{align*}
        [f - g] &= [\Id_{A \oplus B} \circ (f - g)] \\
        &= [\iota_A \circ \pi_A \circ (f - g) + \iota_B \circ \pi_B \circ (f - g)] \\
        &= [\iota_A] \circ [\pi_A \circ (f - g)] + [\iota_B] \circ [\pi_B \circ (f - g)] \\
        &= [0],
    \end{align*}
    which implies that \( [f] = [g] \), and that \( A \oplus B \) is a product in \( \Mc \), and by the statement at the start, also a biproduct.
\end{proof}

The next step in creating a triangulation for \( \Mc \) is to define the shift functor. In the stable module category, the shift functor is the inverse to the ``syzygy functor''. We start by defining what the syzygy functor is, and afterwards define the shift functor.

The syzygy functor as well as the shift functor exists in the category of modules over a commutative ring with identity (e.g., a Frobenius ring) because it has \emph{enough projectives} and \emph{enough injectives}. Having enough projectives means that for any module \( A \), there exists some projective module \( P_A \), as well as an epimorphism \( \pi_A \) from \( P_A \) to \( A \). The choice of \( P_A \) and consequently \( \pi_A \) is not necessarily unique up to isomorphism, and two different choices of \( P_A \) could be non-isomorphic. Similarly, having enough injectives means that for any module \( A \) there exists some injective module \( I_A \) along with a monomorphism \( \iota_A \) from \( A \) to \( I_A \). Equal to the projective case, \( I_A \) is not necessarily unique up to isomorphism and \( \iota_A \) is not necessarily unique.

The definition of the syzygy functor is closely tied to a choice of \( P_A \)'s and \( \pi_A \)'s for every object \( A \).

\begin{definition}[The functor \( \Omega \)]
    \label{def:stmod_omega}
    Let \( R \) be a Frobenius ring.

    Let \( P = \set{\tuple{P_A, \pi_A, \Omega A}}_{A \in \Mod(R)} \) be a collection of tuples for every object \( A \), where \( P_A \) is a projective module, \( \pi_A: P_A \twoheadrightarrow A \) an epimorphism, and \( \Omega A \) is a kernel of \( \pi_A \). This exists because \( \Mod(R) \) has enough projectives.

    Then define \( \Omega \) as the assignment of objects and morphisms in \( \Mc \) as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {
            For any object \( A \) in \( \Mc \), let \( \Omega A \) be as above.
        }
        \item {
            For any \( [f] \in \Mc(A, B) \), let \( \Omega [f] \) be constructed as follows:

            Consider the following diagram in \( \Mod(R) \) excluding the dashed arrows,
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                        \Omega B \& P_B \& B. \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                            edge[dashed] node[swap] {\Omega f} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                            edge[dashed] node {p_f} (m-2-2)
                        (m-1-3) edge node {f} (m-2-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                        (m-2-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            Let \( \Omega f: \Omega A \to \Omega B \) be any morphism that makes the above diagram, for some \( p_f: P_A \to P_B \), commute.

            Then define \( \Omega [f] := \class*{\Omega f} \).
        }
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The goal is to show that \( \Omega: \Mc \to \Mc \) is a well-defined endofunctor, and later showing that it is in fact an additive auto-equivalence of categories.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_omega_f_is_well_defined}
    \( \Omega \) is a well-defined assignment of morphisms.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    There are three things that need to be proven. First, the existence of an \( \Omega f \) for any \( f \). Second, we need to show that for any \( p_f \), then \( \Omega \) still yields the same morphism in \( \Mc \). Third, we need to show that if \( [f] = [g] \), then \( \Omega [f] = \Omega [g] \).

    First, we have that for a morphism \( f: A \to B \), there exists a morphism \( p_f \) from the lifting property of projective modules such that the right square in the definition commutes.

    Furthermore, since
    \[
        \pi_B \circ p_f \circ \iota_A = f \circ \pi_A \circ \iota_A = f \circ 0 = 0,
    \]
    we have from the universal kernel property that there exists a morphism, \( \Omega f \), dependent on the choice of \( p_f \), such that the left square in the definition commutes. This is therefore a valid choice of \( \Omega f \).

    To prove the second part, let \( p_f \) and \( \widetilde{p_f} \) be two different projective morphisms that yield morphisms \( \Omega f \) and \( \widetilde{\Omega f} \), respectively. Then we have the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrow,
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \Omega B \& P_B \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Omega f - \widetilde{\Omega f}} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge[dashed, swap] node {\phi} (m-2-1)
                    edge node {p_f - \widetilde{p_f}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {f -f = 0} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Since
    \[
        \pi_B \circ \tuple{p_f - \widetilde{p_f}} = \tuple{f - f} \circ \pi_A = 0
    \]
    there exists a morphism \( \phi \) induced by the kernel property of \( \Omega B \), such that the lower triangle in the diagram commutes. Then because of the monomorphism property of \( \iota_B \), we also get that the upper triangle commutes. This implies that the morphism \( \Omega f - \widetilde{\Omega f} \) factors through \( P_A \), a projective module. Therefore,
    \[
        [0] = \class{\Omega f - \widetilde{\Omega f}} = \class{\Omega f} - \class{\widetilde{\Omega f}}
    \]
    which implies that \( \Omega [f] \) is independent of the choice of \( p_f \).

    Second, we need to show that if \( [f] = [g] \), then \( \Omega [f] = \Omega [g] \). Consider the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrow,
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{3cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \&\& P \\
                \Omega B \& P_B \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge node {\Omega f - \Omega g} (m-3-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node {p_f - p_g} (m-3-2)
                (m-1-3) edge[swap] node {(f - g)_1} (m-2-3)
                    edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {f - g} (m-3-3)

                (m-2-3) edge[swap, dashed] node {\theta} (m-3-2)
                    edge[swap] node {(f - g)_2} (m-3-3)

                (m-3-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_B} (m-3-2)
                (m-3-2) edge[two headed] node[swap] {\pi_B} (m-3-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Let \( P \) be the projective module that \( f - g \) factors through. Then from the projective property, there exists a morphism \( \theta: P \to P_B \), which causes the lower triangle to commute.

    Let \( p_{f - g} := \theta \circ (f - g)_1 \circ \pi_A \). By construction, we have that both \( p_f - p_g \) and \( p'_{f - g} \) are morphisms that would make the right hand square commute.
    
    But since
    \[
        p_{f - g} \circ \iota_A = \theta \circ (f-g)_1 \circ \pi_A \circ \iota_A = \theta \circ (f-g)_1 \circ 0 = 0,
    \]
    the following diagram commutes,
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \Omega B \& P_B \& B. \\

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge node {0} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node {p_{f - g}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {f - g} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    However, by the second part of this proof, this implies that \( [0] = [\Omega f - \Omega g] \), and therefore \( \Omega [f] = \Omega [g] \).
\end{proof}

Now that \( \Omega \) is a well-defined assignment of objects and morphisms, it only remains to prove functoriality.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_omega_endofunctor}
    \( \Omega \) is an endofunctor on \( \Mc \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    To show that \( \Omega \) is a functor we must prove functoriality.

    First, we show that \( \Omega \) is preserves composition. Let \( A, B, C \in \Mc \). Then by the definition of \( \Omega \), we have the following commutative diagram,
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \Omega B \& P_B \& B \\
                \Omega C \& P_C \& C. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    % edge[curve={height=30pt}, swap] node {\Omega (g \circ f)} (m-3-1)
                    edge node {\Omega f} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node {p_f} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {f} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                    edge node {\Omega g} (m-3-1)
                (m-2-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3)
                    edge node {p_g} (m-3-2)
                (m-2-3) edge node {g} (m-3-3)

                (m-3-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-3-2)
                (m-3-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_B} (m-3-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Considering the composition of the vertical morphisms, we end up with the following commutative diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega C} \& {P_C} \& C. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Omega g \circ \Omega f} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node {p_g \circ p_f} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {g \circ f} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_C} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_C} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Since \( \Omega \) is a well-defined assignment of morphisms, this implies
    \[
        (\Omega [g]) \circ (\Omega [f]) = \class{(\Omega g) \circ (\Omega f)} = \class*{\Omega (g \circ f)} = \Omega \class{g \circ f}.
    \]

    Second, we need to show that \( \Omega [\Id_A] = [\Id_{\Omega A}] \) in \( \Mc \).

    By a similar argument to the one above, we can see that every square and triangle in the following diagram commutes
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[tailed] (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Id_{\Omega A}} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two headed] (m-1-3)
                    edge node {\Id_{P_A}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node {\Id_A} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[tailed] (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two headed] (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Therefore \( \Omega \class{\Id_A} = \class{\Id_{\Omega A}} \).
\end{proof}

Finally, we need the following result to show that \( \Omega \) is additive.

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_omega_additive_functor}
    \( \Omega \) is an additive functor.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We must show that \( \Omega [f + g] = \Omega [f] + \Omega [g] \).
    
    There are two possible values of \( \Omega (f + g) \), namely the ones from either of the two commutative diagrams below,
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega B} \& {P_B} \& B, \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge node {\Omega (f + g)} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node {p_{f + g}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node[swap] {f + g} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                {\Omega A} \& {P_A} \& A \\
                {\Omega B} \& {P_B} \& B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge node {\Omega f + \Omega g} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge node {p_f + p_g} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge node[swap] {f + g} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_B} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_B} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Since \( \Omega [f + g] \) is well-defined, this implies \( \Omega [f + g] = \Omega [f] + \Omega [g] \).
\end{proof}

We can define another functor, \( \Sigma \), which will turn out to be the inverse of \( \Omega \) and the shift functor in the triangulation of \( \Mc \).

% TODO: Kopling med cosyzygy?
\begin{definition}[The functor \( \Sigma \)]
    \label{def:stmod_sigma}
    Let \( R \) be a Frobenius ring.

    Let \( I = \set{\tuple{I_A, \kappa_A, \Sigma A}}_{A \in \Mod(R)} \) be a collection of tuples for every object \( A \), where \( I_A \) is an injective module, \( \kappa_A: A \rightarrowtail I_A \) a monomorphism, and \( \Sigma A \) is a cokernel of \( \kappa_A \). This exists because \( \Mod(R) \) has enough injectives.

    Then define \( \Sigma \) as the assignment of objects and morphisms in \( \Mc \) as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {
            For any object \( A \) in \( \Mc \), let \( \Sigma A \) be as above.
        }
        \item {
            For \( [f] \in \Mc(A, B) \), let \( \Sigma [f] \) be constructed as follows:

            Consider the following diagram in \( \Mod(R) \) excluding the dashed arrows,
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        A \& I_A \& \Sigma A \\
                        B \& I_B \& \Sigma B. \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge[tailed] node {\kappa_A} (m-1-2)
                            edge node {f} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge[two headed] node {\rho_A} (m-1-3)
                            edge[dashed] node {i_f} (m-2-2)
                        (m-1-3) edge[dashed] node {\Sigma f} (m-2-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge[tailed] node {\kappa_B} (m-2-2)
                        (m-2-2) edge[two headed] node {\rho_B} (m-2-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}

            Let \( \Sigma f: \Sigma A \to \Sigma B \) be any morphism that makes the above diagram, for some \( i_f: I_A \to I_B \), commute.

            Then define \( \Sigma [f] := \class*{\Sigma f} \).
        }
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

It remains to show that every desired property of \( \Sigma \), like being well-defined, an endofunctor, and additive, translates to \( \Sigma \).
\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:stmod_sigma_well-defined_additive_endofunctor}
    \( \Sigma \) is a well-defined and additive endofunctor on \( \Mc \).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The proofs of the various statements are entirely dual to the proofs of \autoref{lem:stmod_omega_f_is_well_defined}, \autoref{lem:stmod_omega_endofunctor} and \autoref{lem:stmod_omega_additive_functor}.
\end{proof}

Now we can finally show that \( \Sigma = \Omega^{-1} \).

\begin{theorem}
    \( \Omega \) is an auto-equivalence with inverse \( \Sigma \).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We will only show that \( \Id_{\Mc} \) is naturally isomorphic to \( \Sigma \Omega \). The omitted part that \( \Id_{\Mc} \) is naturally isomorphic to \( \Omega \Sigma \) is very similar, and uses many dual properties.

    First, we show that for any \( A \in \Mc \), there exists an isomorphism \( A \to \Sigma \Omega A \). Consider the following diagram excluding the dashed arrows,
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \Omega A \& I_{\Omega A} \& \Sigma \Omega A \\
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A, \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[equality] (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge[dashed] node {i_{\phi_1}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge[dashed] node {\phi_1} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[tailed] node {\kappa_{\Omega A}} (m-2-2)
                    edge[equality] (m-3-1)
                (m-2-2) edge[two headed] node {\rho_{\Omega A}} (m-2-3)
                    edge[dashed] node {i_{\phi_2}} (m-3-2)
                (m-2-3) edge[dashed] node {\phi_2} (m-3-3)

                (m-3-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-3-2)
                (m-3-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_A} (m-3-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    then there exists \( i_{\phi_1} \) from the injective property of \( I_{\Omega A} \), induced by \( \iota_A \). In addition, since \( \Mod(R) \) is an abelian category, \( A \) is a cokernel of \( \iota_A \), and by
    \[
        \rho_{\Omega A} \circ i_{\phi_1} \circ \iota_A = \rho_{\Omega A} \circ \kappa_{\Omega A} = 0,
    \]
    we get from the cokernel property that there is a uniquely induced morphism \( \phi_1: A \to \Sigma\Omega A \). Then by doing the same for the lower rectangle of the diagram, using the fact that every projective module is also injective, we get the morphisms \( i_{\phi_2} \) and \( \phi_2 \) by similar arguments. This makes the above diagram including the dashed arrows commute.

    To show that \( \phi_1 \) and \( \phi_2 \) are isomorphisms, consider the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrow,
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\Id_{\Omega A} \circ \Id_{\Omega A} - \Id_{\Omega A} = 0} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_A} (m-1-3)
                    edge[swap] node {i_{\phi_2} \circ i_{\phi_1} - \Id_{P_A}} (m-2-2)
                (m-1-3) edge[swap, dashed] node {\theta} (m-2-2)
                    edge node {\phi_2 \circ \phi_1 - \Id_A} (m-2-3)

                (m-2-1) edge[tailed] node {\iota_A} (m-2-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[two headed] node {\pi_A} (m-2-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Since
    \[
        (i_{\phi_2} \circ i_{\phi_1} - \Id_{P_A}) \circ \iota_A = \iota_A \circ 0 = 0,
    \]
    we have from the cokernel property that there exist a morphism \( \theta: A \to P_A \) such that the upper triangle commutes. Thus,
    \[
        (\phi_2 \circ \phi_1 - \Id_A) \circ \pi_A = \pi_A \circ (i_{\theta_2} \circ i_{\theta_1} - \Id_{P_A}) = \pi_A \circ \theta \circ \pi_A,
    \]
    and since \( \pi_A \) is an epimorphism, we get that the lower triangle commutes. This implies that \( [\phi_2 \circ \phi_1 - \Id_A] = [0] \), which implies \( [\phi_2 \circ \phi_1] = [\Id_A] \).
    
    By a similar argument that is omitted for brevity, we can show that \( [\phi_1 \circ \phi_2] = [\Id_{\Sigma\Omega A}] \), which means that \( [\phi_1] \) and \( [\phi_2] \) are isomorphisms from \( A \) to \( \Sigma\Omega A \).

    Finally, to show that these isomorphisms are natural, let \( [f] \in \Mc(A, B) \) and consider the following two commutative diagrams
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \Omega A \& I_{\Omega A} \& \Sigma \Omega A \\
                \Omega B \& I_{\Omega B} \& \Sigma \Omega B, \\

        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    and
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{2cm} {
                \Omega A \& P_A \& A \\
                \Omega B \& P_B \& B \\
                \Omega B \& I_{\Omega B} \& \Sigma \Omega B. \\
            };

            \draw[math]

    These diagrams give rise to the following commutative diagram, excluding the dashed arrow,
    \begin{center}

    % TODO: Sebastian synast eg skal fordjupa her, men det er eit veldig likt argument som det eg har gjort ovanfor fleire gangar. Usikker på kva eg skal gjere her.

    where from the cokernel property of \( A \), we get an induced morphism \( \theta \). Furthermore, from the epimorphism property of \( \pi_A \), the lower triangle commutes. Since \( R \) is assumed to be a Frobenius ring, \( I_{\Omega B} \) is also projective. This implies
    \[
        [\phi_1^B \circ f] = [(\Sigma \Omega f) \circ \phi_1^A],
    \]
    which means that \( [\phi_1] \) is a natural isomorphism from \( \Id_{\Mc} \) to \( \Sigma \Omega \), with inverse \( [\phi_2] \).

    As mentioned at the start, the proof that \( \Id_{\Mc} \) is naturally isomorphic to \( \Omega \Sigma \) is very similar to the above proof, but using dual properties.
\end{proof}

An interesting consequence of how \( \Omega \) and \( \Sigma \) are defined is that if we were to choose a different \( P \) or \( I \) in their definitions, then it would yield different, but naturally isomorphic functors. A proof of this statement for \( \Sigma \) can be found in \cite[p. 13]{Happel_1988}, with the proof for \( \Omega \) being dual.

Before we can show the triangulation of \( \Mc \), we first need to define the cone of a morphism. The definition of a cone, as well as the definition of the distinguished triangles leans heavily upon \cite[Chapter 1, Subsection 2.5]{Happel_1988}.

% TODO: Slå i saman denne definisjonen og remarket nedanfor?
\begin{definition}
    \label{def:stmod_cone}
    Let \( f \in \Mod(R)(A, B) \).
    
    Then define a \emph{cone of \( f \)} to be a pushout object of the following diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& B \\
                I_A, \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {f} (m-1-2)
                    edge node[swap] {\kappa_A} (m-2-1);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    and is labeled as \( C_f \).

    This pushout also defines two morphisms \( g \) and \( \gamma_f \) which fit into the following pushout square,
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& B \\
                I_A \& C_f. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {f} (m-1-2)
                    edge node[swap] {\kappa_A} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge node {g} (m-2-2)

                (m-2-1) edge node {\gamma_f} (m-2-2);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
\end{definition}

Following the definition of a cone, we can define the standard triangles of \( \Mc \) as induced from some triangles in \( \Mod(R) \). The following remark walks through the construction, which will be very useful in proofs.

\begin{remark}
    \label{rem:stmod_cone}
    Let \( f \in \Mod(R)(A, B) \), and let \( C_f, g \) and \( \gamma_f \) be as in \autoref{def:stmod_cone}.
    
    Consider the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrows,
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& B \\
                I_A \& C_f \\
                \& \Sigma A. \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {f} (m-1-2)
                    edge[swap] node {\kappa_A} (m-2-1)
                (m-1-2) edge node {g} (m-2-2)
                    edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {0} (m-3-2)

                (m-2-1) edge node {\gamma_f} (m-2-2)
                    edge node {\rho_A} (m-3-2)
                (m-2-2) edge[dashed] node {h} (m-3-2);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Then there exist some morphism \( h: C_f \to \Sigma A \) from the pushout property of \( C_f \).

    This diagram will form the backbone of the distinguished triangles in \( \Mc \).
\end{remark}

Now, we can finally define the triangulation on \( \Mc \).

\begin{definition}
    \label{def:stmod_delta}
    Let \( \Delta \) be the collection of triangles in \( \Mc \) isomorphic to any triangle of the form
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                A \& B \& C_f \& \Sigma A \\
            };

            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge node {[f]} (m-1-2)
                (m-1-2) edge node {[g]} (m-1-3)
                (m-1-3) edge node {[h]} (m-1-4);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    for any \( f \in \Mod(R)(A, B) \), and where \( C_f \), \( g \), and \( h \) are as defined in \autoref{rem:stmod_cone}.
\end{definition}

There are some important details from the definition of standard triangles that will be important in proving that \( \Mc \) has a triangulation.

% TODO: Sebastian vil at eg skal sløyfa "Consider the objects and ..." setningen. Skal eg?
% -> Veldig nerme. Unngå unødvendige og nære referansar.
\begin{remark}
    \label{rem:stmod_cone_pushout_properties}
    Consider the objects and morphisms of \autoref{rem:stmod_cone}.

    Since \( \Mod(R) \) is an abelian category, then by known facts about pushouts, it follows that since \( \kappa_A \) is a monomorphism, then \( g \) is also a monomorphism since \( \ker(g) = \ker(\kappa_A) = 0 \). Likewise, it follows that \( \coker(g) \cong \coker(\kappa_A) \cong \Sigma A \), and therefore \( h \) is a cokernel morphism of \( g \).
\end{remark}

Since morphisms in \( \Mc \) are residue classes and can therefore have multiple representatives, there are multiple cones for each morphism. Each cone yields a different standard triangle, and there are therefore multiple standard triangles for each morphism. This turns out to not be a problem since it does not conflict with the definition of a triangulated category. In particular, the use of the word ``standard triangle'' and ``cone'' above, still aligns with the definitions given in the definition of a triangulated category.

The following lemma is needed to prove {\bf (TR4)}, however, it also hints to the fact that we could have chosen \( \Delta \) differently, as is done in \cite[Definition 4.16]{Johan_Bachelor}.

    be two pushout squares in \( \Mod(R) \), with \( g \) and \( h \) monomorphisms into injective objects \( I \) and \( I' \).

    Then there exists an isomorphism \( [\alpha]: C \to C' \) in \( \Mc \).
    
    In addition, given a morphism \( i: I \to I' \), such that \( i \circ g = h \), \( \alpha \) has the following properties:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( \alpha \circ g' = h' \), and

    then by the cokernel property of \( C \) there exist a morphism \( \delta \) such that the top triangle in \autoref{diag:C-iso} commutes. However, since \( 
        \begin{psmallmatrix}
            g' & \gamma
        \end{psmallmatrix}
    \) is an epimorphism by definition, it follows that the bottom triangle also commutes.

    We can prove that \( [\alpha \circ \beta] = [\Id_{C'}] \) in a similar way.
\end{proof}

Then finally comes the full triangulation result, the proof of which is heavily inspired by \cite[First theorem in Chapter 1, Subsection 2.6]{Happel_1988}, with additional inspiration for proving {\bf (TR4)} from \cite[Theorem 4.18]{Johan_Bachelor}.

            We need to show \( (\Leftarrow) \) and \( (\Rightarrow) \). By \autoref{lem:triangulated_category-TR2-only_one_rotation}, assuming the upcoming proof of {\bf (TR3)} as well as the previous proof of {\bf (TR1)}, then \( (\Leftarrow) \) is implied by \( (\Rightarrow) \).
            
            Therefore it is sufficient to only prove \( (\Rightarrow) \).

            With the above diagrams in mind, consider the following commutative diagram excluding the dahed arrow,

            Consider the following equalities that follow from the above commutative diagrams
            \[

            This implies that considering the following pushout diagram

            would have two different morphisms, \( \rho_B \circ \phi \) and \( \Sigma f \circ h \), that could satisfy the pushout universal property. By uniqueness, they therefore have to be the same morphism, i.e.,
            \[
                \rho_B \circ \phi = \Sigma f \circ h.

            Then it remains to check if

            By considering two arbitrary distinguished triangles, any morphism between their components will induce a unique morphism between the component of their standard triangles they are isomorphic to, and vice versa. Therefore it suffices to only check {\bf (TR3)} for standard triangles.

            In addition, by the argument made in {\bf (TR2)}, we can not assume {\bf (TR2)} (\( \Leftarrow \)) in this proof, as that would yield a circular argument.

            then since \( [l] \circ [\alpha] = [\beta] \circ [f] \) in \( \Mc \), we have that \( l \circ \alpha - \beta \circ f \) factors through a projective. However, since projectives are injectives, then by the universal property of injective objects applied to \( \kappa_A \), it follows that \( l \circ \alpha - \beta \circ f \) factors through \( \kappa_A \) and that there is some morphism \( \xi: I_A \to E \) such that
            \[

            Furthermore, consider the following diagram by definition of \( \Sigma [\alpha] \)

                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            then we can construct the morphism which will be used below
            \[
                \gamma_{l} \circ i_{\alpha} - m \circ \xi: I_A \to C_{l}.
            \]

            Since
            \begin{align*}
                m \circ \beta \circ f &= m \circ l \circ \alpha - m \circ \xi \circ \kappa_A \\
                &= \gamma_{l} \circ \kappa_{D} \circ \alpha - m \circ \xi \circ \kappa_A \\
                &= \gamma_{l} \circ i_{\alpha} \circ \kappa_A - m \circ \xi \circ \kappa_A \\

            \end{align*}
            then by the pushout property of \( C_f \) it follows that there exists some unique \( \phi \) such that the following diagram commutes
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}

                        I_A \& C_f \\
                        \& \& C_{l}. \\

                            edge node {\kappa_A} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge node {g} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {m \circ \beta} (m-3-3)

                        (m-2-2) edge[dashed] node {\phi} (m-3-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            In particular \( \phi \circ \gamma_f = \gamma_{l} \circ i_{\alpha} - m \circ \xi \).

            Finally, check that this \( \phi \) makes \autoref{eq:stablemod} commute.

            By the commutativity of the pushout diagram, the middle square of \autoref{eq:stablemod} commutes. Then it remains to check if \( [n \circ \phi] = [(\Sigma \alpha) \circ h] \). Consider the following pushout diagram that commutes because \( (\Sigma \alpha) \circ h \circ \gamma_f \circ \kappa_A = (\Sigma \alpha) \circ \rho_A \circ \kappa_A = 0 \),

                        (m-2-2) edge[dashed] (m-3-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            and the following two equations
            \[
                n \circ \phi \circ g = n \circ m \circ \beta = 0 = (\Sigma \alpha) \circ h \circ g,
            \]
            and
            \[
                (\Sigma \alpha) \circ h \circ \gamma_f = (\Sigma \alpha) \circ \rho_A = \rho_{D} \circ i_{\alpha} = n \circ \gamma_{l} \circ i_{\alpha} = n \circ (\phi \circ \gamma_f + m \circ \xi) = n \circ \phi \circ \gamma_f.
            \]
            These implies that there are two choices of dashed line in the above diagram that would make it commute. However, by uniqueness, this implies they are equal and therefore
            \[
                (\Sigma \alpha) \circ h = n \circ \phi.

            By definition, the square left of \( \phi \) in \autoref{diag:stmod_tr4} commutes. In order to check if the square to the right commutes, consider the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrow

                        \& \& \Sigma A. \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge node {f} (m-1-2)
                            edge node {\kappa_A} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge node {g} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {l \circ j \circ n} (m-3-3)
                        
                        (m-2-1) edge node {\gamma_f} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=25pt}] node[swap] {l \circ \gamma_{n \circ f}} (m-3-3)
                        (m-2-2) edge[dashed] (m-3-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            Consider the following equations
            \[
                l \circ \phi \circ g = l \circ j \circ n = n \circ 0 = 0 = h \circ g,
            \]
            and
            \[
                l \circ \phi \circ \gamma_f = l \circ \gamma_{n \circ f} = \rho_A = h \circ \gamma_f,
            \]
            which, by the pushout morphism uniqueness, implies that
            \[
                l \circ \phi = h.
            \]
            And therefore the square to the right of \( \phi \) in \autoref{diag:stmod_tr4_C} also commutes.

            In order to construct \( \psi \) we have to first define two morphisms which will be used in its definition.

            By \autoref{rem:stmod_cone_pushout_properties} it follows that \( g \) is a monomorphism. And since \( \kappa_{C_f} \) is also a monomorphism, it follows that
            \[
                \kappa_{C_f} \circ g: B \to I_{C_f}
            \]
            is also a monomorphism. Then by the injective object property of \( I_B \), there exist some morphism \( i: I_{C_f} \to I_B \) which makes the following diagram commute,
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{0.5cm} {
                        \& B \\
                        I_{C_f} \& \& I_B. \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-2) edge node[swap] {\kappa_{C_f} \circ g} (m-2-1)
                            edge node {\kappa_B} (m-2-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge node {i} (m-2-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            By the injective property of \( I_{C_f} \), there also exists some \( \tilde{i} \) such that the following diagram commutes,
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{0.5cm} {
                        \& B \\
                        I_{C_f} \& \& I_B. \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-2) edge node[swap] {\kappa_{C_f} \circ g} (m-2-1)

                        (m-2-3) edge node {\tilde{i}} (m-2-1);

            \end{center}
            
            Now we can move on to defining \( \psi \).

                            edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {m} (m-3-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge node {\gamma_{n \circ f}} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=25pt}] node[swap] {\gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f} (m-3-3)
                        (m-2-2) edge[dashed] node {\psi} (m-3-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            which commutes because
            \begin{equation}
                \label{diag:stmod_tr4_m_n_f_equal_something_else}
                \begin{aligned}
                    m \circ n \circ f &= \gamma_n \circ \kappa_B \circ f \\
                    &= \gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ g \circ f \\
                    &= \gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f \circ \kappa_A.
                \end{aligned}
            \end{equation}
            Thus, by the pushout property, there exists a morphism \( \psi: C_{n \circ f} \to C_n \) such that the above diagram including the dashed arrow commutes.

            To show that \( \psi \) makes \autoref{diag:stmod_tr4} commute in \( \Mc \), we can see that the square to the left of \( \psi \) commutes by definition, and so it remains to choose some \( \Sigma f \) such that the square to the right also commutes.

            Consider the following diagram excluding the dashed arrow,
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        A \& I_A \& \Sigma A \\
                        \& C_f \\
                        \& I_{C_f} \\
                        B \& I_B \& \Sigma B, \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge node {\kappa_A} (m-1-2)
                            edge node[swap] {f} (m-4-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge node {\rho_A} (m-1-3)
                            edge node {\gamma_f} (m-2-2)
                        (m-1-3) edge[dashed] node {\Sigma f} (m-4-3)

                        (m-2-2) edge node {\kappa_{C_f}} (m-3-2)

                        (m-3-2) edge node {i} (m-4-2)

                        (m-4-1) edge node {\kappa_B} (m-4-2)
                            edge node {g} (m-2-2)
                        (m-4-2) edge node {\rho_B} (m-4-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            which commutes because the top left and bottom left ``triangles'' of the diagram commute. Then since
            \[
                \rho_B \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f \circ \kappa_A = \rho_B \circ \kappa_B = 0,
            \]
            it follows by the cokernel property of \( \Sigma A \) that there exist some morphism, \( \Sigma f \), which is denoted as such because it fits \autoref{def:stmod_sigma}.

            Then consider the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrow,
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        A \& D \\
                        I_A \& C_{n \circ f} \\
                        \& \& \Sigma B, \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge node {n \circ f} (m-1-2)
                            edge node {\kappa_A} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge node {j} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {0} (m-3-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge node {\gamma_{n \circ f}} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=25pt}] node[swap] {k \circ \gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f} (m-3-3)
                        (m-2-2) edge[dashed] (m-3-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            where
            \[
                \Sigma f \circ l \circ j = \Sigma f \circ 0 = 0 = k \circ m = k \circ \psi \circ j
            \]
            and
            \begin{align*}
                k \circ \psi \circ \gamma_{n \circ f} &= k \circ \gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f \\
                &= \rho_B \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f \\
                &= \Sigma f \circ \rho_A \\
                &= \Sigma f \circ l \circ \gamma_{n \circ f}.
            \end{align*}
            Then by uniqueness of the pushout property it follows that \( k \circ \psi = \Sigma f \circ l \).
                
            Therefore the square to the right of \( \psi \) in \autoref{diag:stmod_tr4} commutes.

            Finally, it remains to check that
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        C_f \& C_{n \circ f} \& C_n \& \Sigma C_f \\
                    };

                        (m-1-3) edge node {\Sigma([g]) \circ [k]} (m-1-4);

            \end{center}
            is a distinguished triangle.

            We will construct a standard triangle of \( [\phi] \) and then show that this triangle is isomorphic to the above triangle.

            Consider the following commutative diagram

                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            Since the left and the outer square are pushouts this implies that the right square is also a pushout.

            Consider the following pushout diagram of \( (B, n, \kappa_{C_f} \circ g) \),
            \begin{diagramlabel}[\label{diag:stmod_tr4_C}]

            By the pushout property, there exist a morphism \( x: C_{n \circ f} \to C \) such that the above diagram including \( x \) commutes.
            
            Consider the following commutative diagram,

                \begin{tikzpicture}

            Since the outer rectangle and upper squares of \autoref{diag:stmod_tr4_m_n_f_equal_something_else} are pushouts, then the lower square is also a pushout.

            This implies that there exists a morphism \( p \) by the pushout property, such that the following diagram

            By \autoref{lem:stmod_pushout_different_injectives_isomorphic} it follows that there exists some \( \alpha: C \to C_n \) such that \( [\alpha] \) is an isomorphism in \( \Mc \), and the following equalities hold:

                \item \( \alpha \circ \delta = m \), and

            The leftmost square commutes by difficult mathematics.

            In order to prove that the middle square commutes, consider the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrow,
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {

                            edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {m \circ n} (m-3-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge node {\gamma_f} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=25pt}] node[swap] {\gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f} (m-3-3)
                        (m-2-2) edge[dashed] (m-3-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            where the inner square is a pushout and the outer ``square'' commutes by \autoref{diag:stmod_tr4_m_n_f_equal_something_else}.

            Note the following equalities,
            \begin{align*}
                \psi \circ \phi \circ g &= \psi \circ j \circ n \\
                &= m \circ n \\
                &= \gamma_n \circ \kappa_B \\
                &= \gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ g,
            \end{align*}
            and
            \begin{align*}
                \psi \circ \phi \circ \gamma_f &= \psi \circ \gamma_{n \circ f} \\
                &= \gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ \gamma_f,
            \end{align*}
            which implies by the uniqueness of the pushout morphism that
            \[
                \psi \circ \phi = \gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f}.
            \]

            With the above equality in mind, consider the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrow,
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {

                        \& \& C_n. \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]

                            edge node[swap] {g} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge node {j} (m-2-2)

                        (m-2-2) edge[dashed] (m-3-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            Consider the following two equations,
            \[
                \alpha \circ x \circ j = \alpha \circ \delta = m = \psi \circ j,
            \]
            and
            \[
                \alpha \circ x \circ \phi = \alpha \circ \gamma \circ \kappa_{C_f} = \gamma_n \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} = \psi \circ \phi,
            \]
            it follows that by the uniqueness of the pushout that \( \alpha \circ x = \psi \), and so the middle square of \autoref{diag:stmod_tr4_iso} commutes.
            
            It remains to show that the rightmost square commutes, which requires some additional tools.

            Let \( E := \coker(\delta)\). Since \autoref{diag:stmod_tr4_C} is a pushout, we also have that \( E = \coker(\kappa_{C_f} \circ g) \). Let \( c: I_{C_f} \to E \) be the cokernel morphism of \( \kappa_{C_f} \circ g \).

            Let \( e \) and \( e^{-1} \) be the (dashed) morphisms induced by the cokernel properties which fit in the following commutative diagram,
            \begin{center}

            \end{center}
            
            We can verify that \( [e \circ e^{-1}] = [\Id_B] \) by \autoref{lem:stmod_sigma_well-defined_additive_endofunctor}. Similarly we can verify that \( [e^{-1} \circ e] = [\Id_E] \).

            \end{center}

            Before proving \( [(\Sigma g) \circ k \circ \alpha] = [p] \), we first have to prove some relations between the new morphisms and the old ones.

            First note the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrow
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        B \& D \\
                        I_{C_f} \& C \\
                        \& \& \Sigma B \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge node {n} (m-1-2)
                            edge node[swap] {\kappa_{C_f} \circ g} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge node {\delta} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {0} (m-3-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge node {\gamma} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=25pt}] node {\rho_B \circ i} (m-3-3)
                        (m-2-2) edge[dashed] (m-3-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}
            where the outer ``square'' commutes because
            \[
                \rho_B \circ i \circ \kappa_{C_f} \circ g = \rho_B \circ \kappa_B = 0.
            \]
            Both \( e \circ d \) and \( k \circ \alpha \) could fit as the dashed arrow, because
            \[
                k \circ \alpha \circ \delta = k \circ m = 0 = 0 \circ \delta = e \circ d \circ \delta,
            \]
            and
            \[
                k \circ \alpha \circ \gamma = k \circ \gamma_n \circ i = \rho_B \circ i = e \circ c = e \circ d \circ \gamma.
            \]
            and therefore by uniqueness of the universal property of the pushout, \( e \circ d = k \circ \alpha \).

            Similarly to above, consider the following commutative diagram excluding the dashed arrow,
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzpicture}
                    \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
                        B \& D \\
                        I_{C_f} \& C \\
                        \& \& \Sigma C_f. \\
                    };

                    \draw[math]
                        (m-1-1) edge node {n} (m-1-2)
                            edge node[swap] {\kappa_{C_f} \circ g} (m-2-1)
                        (m-1-2) edge node {\delta} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=-25pt}] node {0} (m-3-3)

                        (m-2-1) edge node {\gamma} (m-2-2)
                            edge[curve={height=25pt}] node {\rho_{C_f}} (m-3-3)
                        (m-2-2) edge[dashed] (m-3-3);
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}

            We can verify that \( p \) already fits as a dashed arrow, since \( p \circ \delta = p \circ x \circ j = 0 \circ j = 0 \). However, \( \mu \circ d \) also fits, by the following equations:
            \[
                \mu \circ d \circ \delta = \mu \circ 0 = 0
            \]
            and
            \[
               \mu \circ d \circ \gamma = \mu \circ c = \rho_{C_f}.
            \]
            Therefore by the uniqueness of the universal property of the pushout, \( p = \mu \circ d \).

            Combining everything, we get the following equation
            \[
                [(\Sigma g) \circ k \circ \alpha] = [(\Sigma g) \circ e \circ d] =[\mu \circ e^{-1} \circ e \circ d] = [\mu \circ d] = [p],
            \]
            which finishes the proof, since \( [\alpha] \) is an isomorphism. \qedhere

    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

By \cite[Lemma, Subsection 7.5]{Krause_2007} it follows that \( \Mc \) is in fact what we call an \emph{algebraic triangulated category}. This will be touched on later in the thesis. % TODO: Specify where it will be touched on and the connection between Krause and Jasso-Muro's definition.
