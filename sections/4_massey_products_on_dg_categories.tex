The goal of this section is to calculate Massey products in algebraic triangulated categories. In order to get there, we need some preliminary definitions and results. This section defines what the usual Massey product looks like on the cohomology category of a DG-category. In subsequent sections, we will use the usual definition of Massey product to extend the definition to work on any algebraic triangulated category.

To keep the notation brief, we will use the following convention for the chain complex of modules.
\begin{notation}
    Let \( R \) be a commutative ring with identity.

    Then denote \( \C(\Mod(R)) \) as simply \( \C \).
\end{notation}

Since \( \Mod(R) \) is abelian and bicomplete, \( \C \) is also abelian and bicomplete.
