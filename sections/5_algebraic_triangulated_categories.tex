The goal of this section is to define what an ``algebraic triangulated category'' is, as well as ``DG-modules,'' which as discussed earlier, is necessary to connect Toda brackets to Massey products.

There are multiple definitions of an algebraic triangulated category. In this thesis, the definition of an algebraic triangulated category will be the existence of a (small) DG-enhancement as defined in \cite[Definition 3.1.3]{Jasso-Muro_2023}. This definition is perfect for us, since it makes calculating the Massey product easier.
