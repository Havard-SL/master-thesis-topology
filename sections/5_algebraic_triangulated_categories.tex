The goal of this section is to define what an ``algebraic triangulated category'' is, and end up with a definition of Massey products on an algebraic triangulated category.

There are multiple definitions of an algebraic triangulated category. In this thesis, the definition of an algebraic triangulated category will be the existence of a DG-enhancement as defined in \cite[Definition 3.1.3]{Jasso-Muro_2023}. This necessitates defining what a DG-module is first.
