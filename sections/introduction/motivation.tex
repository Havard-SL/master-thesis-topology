TODO

A goal of this thesis was to be as thorough as possible, without repeating perfectly reasonable proofs. To achieve this, many results and definitions had to be written in more detail than their source due to the source material being too vague with regards to certain details that are neccessary for future results. I have tried to the best of my ability to simply cite proofs and results that are ``detailed enough'' in my opinion.
