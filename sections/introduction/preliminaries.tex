Toda brackets and Massey products are closely linked to triangulated categories. In reality, a triangulated category is a purely algebraic construction, but in essence it is closely linked with many topological structures that appear in the wild. (TODO: Examples of topological constructions?)

A triangulated category is an additive category with some additional data. Firstly, it has an auto-equivalence onto itself, called the shift functor, usually denoted as \( \Sigma \). Secondly it has a collection of diagrams
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
            X_1 \& X_2 \& X_3 \& \Sigma(X_1) \\
        };

        \draw[math]
            (m-1-1) edge node {f_1} (m-1-2)
            (m-1-2) edge node {f_2} (m-1-3)
            (m-1-3) edge node {f_3} (m-1-4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
called distinguished triangles. And thirdly, the category along with the shift functor as well as the distinguished triangles satisfy four axioms, called T1, T2, T3 and T4. WIP

A symmetric monoidal category is TODO

An enriched category is TODO
