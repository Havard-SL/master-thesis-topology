One cannot talk about Massey products or Toda brackets without mentioning triangulated categories. Triangulated categories was allegedly discovered independently by Dieter Puppe and Jean-Louis Verdier in 1962 and 1963 respectively. Verdier introduced his axioms in his doctoral thesis, supervised by the famous Alexander Groethendieck, leading to the attribution for the discovery of triangulated category sometimes being split three ways between Puppe, Verdier, and Groethendieck. Puppe discovered triangulated categories while looking at the stable homotopy category, while Verdier and Groethendieck were motivated from a more algebraic viewpoint by the derived categroy of an abelian category.

As it's discovery would imply, triangulated categories are useful in both algebra and topology. Notable algebra inspired triangulated categories are: the derived categories of abelian category as mentioned above, the stable module category, as well as the homotopy category of chain complexes. On the other hand, notable topology inspired triangulated categories are: the stable homotopy category, and the Spanier-Whitehead category. This thesis will touch a little upon the Spanier-Whitehead category and the derived category of an abelian category in section 2, but will mainly focus on the stable module category for use in examples throughout the thesis, along with a proof that it's a triangulated category in section 2.
