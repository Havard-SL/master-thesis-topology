Triangulated categories were discovered independently by Dieter Puppe and Jean-Louis Verdier in 1962 and 1963, respectively. Verdier introduced his axioms in his doctoral thesis, supervised by Alexander Grothendieck, leading to the attribution for the discovery of triangulated category sometimes being split three ways between Puppe, Verdier, and Grothendieck. Puppe discovered triangulated categories while looking at the stable homotopy category, while Verdier and Grothendieck were motivated from a more algebraic viewpoint by the derived category of an abelian category.

As their discovery would imply, triangulated categories are useful in both algebra and topology. Typical algebraic examples of triangulated categories are: the derived categories of abelian category as mentioned above, the stable module category, as well as the homotopy category of chain complexes. On the other hand, typical topological examples of triangulated categories are: the stable homotopy category, and the Spanier--Whitehead category. In \autoref{section:2} we will discuss triangulated categories in more detail. This thesis will touch a little upon the Spanier--Whitehead category (\autoref{subsubsection:spanier_whitehead_cat}) and the chain homotopy category (\autoref{subsubsection:chain_homotopy_cat}), but will mainly focus on the stable module category (\autoref{subsubsection:stable_module_cat}) for use in examples throughout the thesis, along with a proof that it's a triangulated category (\autoref{example:stable_module_category_triangulated}).

Toda brackets were initially introduced by Hiroshi Toda in 1962 for use in calculating homotopy groups of spheres. The definition of Toda brackets in any triangulated category is based on the work of Shipley in 2002 \cite[Definition A.2]{Shipley_2002}. She bases her definition on ideas from Cohen in 1968 \cite[Definition at the bottom of p. 308]{Cohen_1968}. Shipley's definition was further refined by Sagave in 2008 \cite[Remark 4.5]{Sagave_2008}. The definitions in this thesis is a more elegant formulation of Sagave's definitions by Christensen and Frankland in 2017 \cite[Definition 3.1]{Christensen-Frankland_2017}. The definitions and some examples of calculations will be discussed in \autoref{section:3}.

Massey products were introduced by William Schumacher Massey in 1958. They can be defined in a DG-category (\autoref{def:massey_product_dg_cat}) and further generalized to be defined in any algebraic triangulated category (\autoref{def:massey_product_alg_tri_cat}). Both DG-categories (\autoref{def:dg_cat}) and algebraic triangulated categories (\autoref{def:alg_tri_cat}) will be defined in this thesis. In general, it is known that computing Massey products is easier than computing Toda brackets TODO: CITE. Luckily, it turns out that in an algebraic triangulated category, Massey products and Toda brackets coincide with a small sign difference as follows
\[
    TODO,
\]
which will be proved in \autoref{theorem:massey_equals_toda}.

In \autoref{section:7} we will discuss further applications of this equality between Massey products and Toda brackets.
