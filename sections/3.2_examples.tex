To get a better understanding of how to compute Toda brackets, as well as illustrate some properties they have, this section contains four simple examples in the category \( \Mc := \StMod(R) \) where \( R := \Fb_2 C_2 \), which will serve as a warm-up for the future more complicated examples.

The following remark contains some preliminary information that is helpful in the following computations:

\begin{remark}
	\label{rem:toda_bracket_examples_properties}
    Let \( g \) denote the generator of \( C_2 \).

    The ideal \( J := \tuple{1 + g} \) is the only non-trivial ideal in \( R \) (up to isomorphism).

    The ideal \( J \) is not projective, since the short exact sequence
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm}{
                J \& R \& J, \\
            };
        
            \draw[math]
                (m-1-1) edge[hook] node {\iota} (m-1-2)
                (m-1-2) edge[two heads] node {\phi} (m-1-3);
        \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    where \( \iota \) is the inclusion and \( \phi \) is the morphism
    \begin{align*}
        \phi: R &\to J \\
        0, 1 + g &\mapsto 0 \\
        1, g &\mapsto 1 + g,
    \end{align*}
    is not split.

    This is because \( \iota \) is the only monomorphism of \( J \) into \( R \), but composes to \( 0 \) with \( \phi \). Therefore \( J \) cannot be projective, since every epimorphism into a projective module splits.

    The supension \( \Sigma J \) is assumed to be the cokernel of \( \iota_J \), which by the short exact sequence above, can be assumed to be \( J \).

	% Furthermore, since \( \phi \) is an epimorphism with kernel \( J \), one gets from the third isomorphism theorem that \( \frac{R}{J} \cong J \). Let the isomorphism from \( \frac{R}{J} \) to \( J \) also be denoted as \( \phi \).
\end{remark}

Here are the examples:

\begin{example}
	Let the following be a diagram in \( \Mc \)
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm}{
					J \& J \& J \& J \\
			};

			\draw[math]
				(m-1-1) edge node {[\Id_J]} (m-1-2)
				(m-1-2) edge node {[0]} (m-1-3)
				(m-1-3) edge node {[\Id_J]} (m-1-4);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	want to calculate the Toda bracket \( \toda{\Id_J, 0, \Id_J} \).

	Using the iterated cofiber definition of Toda bracket, then the first step is to calculate the standard triangle of \( \Id_J \). By the assumptions in \autoref{rem:toda_bracket_examples_properties}, the cone is isomorphic to \( 0 \) and the suspension of \( \Id_J \) is \( J \).

	This yields the following distinguished triangle
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
				J \& J \& 0 \& J. \\
			};

			\draw[math]
				(m-1-1) edge node {[\Id_J]} (m-1-2)
				(m-1-2) edge node {[0]} (m-1-3)
				(m-1-3) edge node {[0]} (m-1-4);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}

	Using the iterated cofiber definition of Toda bracket, one gets the following diagram
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
				J \& J \& 0 \& J \\
				J \& J \& J \& J \\
			};

			\draw[math]
				(m-1-1) edge node {[\Id_J]} (m-1-2)
					edge[equal] (m-2-1)
				(m-1-2) edge node {[0]} (m-1-3)
					edge[equal] (m-2-2)
				(m-1-3) edge node {[0]} (m-1-4)
					edge node {[\rho]} (m-2-3)
				(m-1-4) edge node {[\psi]} (m-2-4)

				(m-2-1) edge node {[\Id_J]} (m-2-2)
				(m-2-2) edge node {[0]} (m-2-3)
				(m-2-3) edge node {[\Id_J]} (m-2-4);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}

	But this shows that any endomorphism on \( J \) makes the rightmost square commute, and is therefore in the Toda bracket. In addition, since \( \Mod(R)(J, J) \) is simply \( \set{0, \Id_J} \), this implies that \( \Mc(J, J) = \set{[0], [\Id_J]} \).

	Therefore \( \toda{[\Id_J], [0], [\Id_J]} = \set{[0], [\Id_J]} \). 
\end{example}

One thing that was shown in this example, is that the Toda bracket is dependant on the choice of \( I \) in \autoref{def:stmod_sigma}. In the previous example, one could have assumed \( \Sigma J \) to be \( \frac{R}{J} \), which would have yielded the Toda bracket \( \toda{[\Id_J], [0], [\Id_J]} = \set{[0], [\phi]} \). Therefore, in the future, for applications of Toda brackets on stable module categories, it is important to keep in mind that the choice of \( I \) in the definition of \( \Sigma \) is consistent.

\begin{example}
	\label{ex:toda_bracket-1}
	Want to calculate \( \toda{\Id_J, \Id_J, \Id_J} \).

	One has the following diagram by the iterated cofiber definition of toda bracket using the assumptions made in \autoref{rem:toda_bracket_examples_properties}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
				J \& J \& 0 \& J \\
				J \& J \& J \& J. \\
			};

			\draw[math]
				(m-1-1) edge node {[\Id_J]} (m-1-2)
					edge[equal] (m-2-1)
				(m-1-2) edge node {[0]} (m-1-3)
					edge[equal] (m-2-2)
				(m-1-3) edge node {[0]} (m-1-4)
					edge[squiggly] node {[\rho]} (m-2-3)
				(m-1-4) edge node {[\psi]} (m-2-4)

				(m-2-1) edge node {[\Id_J]} (m-2-2)
				(m-2-2) edge node {[\Id_J]} (m-2-3)
				(m-2-3) edge node {[\Id_J]} (m-2-4);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}

	However there is an issue. There exists no \( [\rho]: 0 \to J \) such that \( [\rho] \circ [0] = [0]: J \to J \) is equal to \( [\Id_J] \). It could only be true if \( J \cong 0 \), which it is not, since \( J \) is not projective by the argument in \autoref{rem:toda_bracket_examples_properties}.

	Therefore the Toda bracket is \emph{empty}, i.e. \( \toda{\Id_J, \Id_J, \Id_J} = \emptyset \).
\end{example}

The previous example shows another important property of Toda brackets, namely that it can be empty in certain circumstances. The following proposition and proof shows this property.

\begin{proposition}
	Let \( f_1, f_2, f_3 \) be three composable maps in any triangulated category, \( \Tc \),
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
				X_1 \& X_2 \& X_3 \& X_4 \\
			};

			\draw[math]
				(m-1-1) edge node {f_1} (m-1-2)
				(m-1-2) edge node {f_2} (m-1-3)
				(m-1-3) edge node {f_3} (m-1-4);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}
	such that \( f_2 \circ f_1 \neq 0 \) or \( f_3 \circ f_2 \neq 0 \).

	Then \( \toda{f_3, f_2, f_1} = \emptyset \).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Assume that \( \toda{f_3, f_2, f_1} \neq \emptyset \). Then from the iterated cofiber definition of Toda bracket there exists maps \(\alpha, \beta, \phi, \psi \) such that the following diagram commutes, and the top row is distinguished
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
				X_1 \& X_2 \& C_{f_1} \& \Sigma X_1 \\
				X_1 \& X_2 \& X_3 \& X_4. \\
			};

			\draw[math]
				(m-1-1) edge node {f_1} (m-1-2)
					edge[equal]	(m-2-1)
				(m-1-2) edge node {\alpha} (m-1-3)
					edge[equal] (m-2-2)
				(m-1-3) edge node {\beta} (m-1-4)
					edge node {\phi} (m-2-3)
				(m-1-4) edge node {\psi} (m-2-4)

				(m-2-1) edge node {f_1} (m-2-2)
				(m-2-2) edge node {f_2} (m-2-3)
				(m-2-3) edge node {f_3} (m-2-4);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}

	Split the proof into two different contradictions:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item{
			Case 1:

			Assume that \( f_2 \circ f_1 \neq 0 \). Then since \( \alpha, f_1 \) are two composable maps from the same distinguished triangle one has
			\[
				\phi \circ \alpha \circ f_1 = \phi \circ 0 = 0.
			\]

			But from commutativity of the diagram one also has
			\[
				\phi \circ \alpha \circ f_1 = f_2 \circ f_1 \neq 0.
			\]

			Which is a contradiction.
		}
		\item{
			Case 2:

			Assume that \( f_3 \circ f_2 \neq 0 \). Then one has that
			\[
				0 = \psi \circ 0 = \psi \circ \beta \circ \alpha = f_3 \circ \phi \circ \alpha = f_3 \circ f_2 \neq 0.
			\]
			Which is also a contradiction.
		}
	\end{itemize}

	Therefore both \( f_2 \circ f_1 = 0 \) and \( f_3 \circ f_2 = 0 \) if \( \toda{f_3, f_2, f_1} \neq \emptyset \), which is contrapositive to the statement in the theorem.
\end{proof}

The following example is a generalization of \autoref{ex:toda_bracket-1} on any triangulated category \( \Tc \).

\begin{example}
	Want to compute \( \toda{f, 0, \Id} \) for any triangulated category \( \Tc \) and for any \( f \in \Tc(X_2, X_3) \).

	First note that on any triangulated category, the cone of the identity morphism is isomorphic to \( 0 \). Then using the iterated cofiber definition of Toda brackets, one gets the following diagram
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\diagram{m}{1cm}{1cm} {
				X_1 \& X_1 \& 0 \& \Sigma X_1 \\
				X_1 \& X_1 \& X_2 \& X_3. \\
			};

			\draw[math]
				(m-1-1) edge node {\Id} (m-1-2)
					edge[equal] (m-2-1)
				(m-1-2) edge (m-1-3)
					edge[equal] (m-2-2)
				(m-1-3) edge (m-1-4)
					edge (m-2-3)
				(m-1-4) edge node {\phi} (m-2-4)

				(m-2-1) edge node {\Id} (m-2-2)
				(m-2-2) edge node {0} (m-2-3)
				(m-2-3) edge node {f} (m-2-4);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{center}

	Here one has that any possible \( \psi: \Sigma X_1 \to X_3 \) will make the right square commute. Therefore \( \toda{f_3, 0, \Id} = \Tc(\Sigma X_1, X_3) \).
\end{example}

Finally, the last example will be in \( \Mc \), but a little more complicated computation.

WIP.
